Climate Change 
and Indian Agriculture:
more frequent extreme weather 
conditions, changes in precipitation 
and expansion of deserts as well. By 
2100, the mean global sea levels are 
projected to rise from 18 cm to 140 
cm (IPCC, 2007). The world has been 
facing environmental problems for the 
last 15 years (Sathaye, 2007). In 2019, 
several parts of Europe have 
registered highest temperatures over 
the past 100 years. Several variations 
in climate like devastating ﬂoods, 
cyclones, droughts, storms, heat 
waves, melting of glaciers, changes in 
pattern and rate of precipitation, 
diseases in agricultural productivity, 
shortage of fresh water, damage to 
ecosystem and environment, etc., are 
indicators of climate change, and 
South Asian countries were adversely 
aﬀected for the past few years. There 
is a necessity of taking possible 
actions to overcome these negative 
changes. The Marshall Island pledged 
to minimize the Carbon (C) emission 
rates by 32 percent by 2025 with a net 
total of zero emissions by 2050 
(Saddington and David, 2016). The 
Bangladesh government has reported 
Climate and agriculture are intensely interconnected with global processes. Even a 
small change in climate aﬀects agriculture adversely decreasing the production 
rate. Climate change eﬀect through global warming phenomenon increases the 
average atmospheric temperature, which has become a mega trend changing the 
global future signiﬁcantly. In 1972, the club of Rome Report oﬃcially conﬁrmed 
that the global warming as an international issue; and the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) also 
declared that Carbon dioxide (CO ) is the principal cause of climate change 
2
because of its highest contribution in global warming. Assessment of the eﬀects of 
global climatic variations on agriculture is imperative to adapt farming and to 
enhance agricultural production (Fraser et al., 2008).

'Climate change' is a deﬁning issue 
currently. A lot of signiﬁcant long-
term changes are happening in global 
climatic system which are visible all 
over the world. The direct solar 
radiations (enormous amount of 
heat/energy) striking on earth's 
surface is being trapped by Green 
House Gases (GHGs) like carbon 
dioxide (CO ), methane (CH ), nitrous 
2
4
oxide (N O), hydroﬂuorocarbons 
2
(HFCs), etc., resulting in atmospheric 
temperature increase. Speciﬁcally, the 
CO  levels are at peak and its 
2
concentration has reached up to 410 
ppm (
 at 
http://scripssco2.ucsd.edu)
present, which is a principal cause of 
warming eﬀect (Figure-1). 
Geographical and phenological shifts 
occur due to the modiﬁcation in 
ecological construction through global 
climate change (Van den Bossche and 
Coetzer, 2008; Slenning, 2010). 
Global warming or climate change 
impacts include rising sea levels, 
Climate Change: Global 
Status
danger level in 2008. Worst ﬂoods 
ever aﬀected Kerala (a South Indian 
state) in 2018 due to unusual high 
rainfall. Millions of people were 
evacuated from their places. As 
predicted by Computer Science 
Engineering (CSE): FACT 17, the 
western semi-arid zones of India will 
receive maximum rainfall than 
normal, while the central parts of 
India will experience rainfall 
reduction of 10 to 20 per cent during 
winter by 2050s. Few years back, the 
Chennai city experienced high level 
of ﬂoods, and the same city in 2019 
was the worst hit with severe drinking 
water crisis leading to large scale 
migrations. Climate change is 
threatening the existence of Maldives 
islands, and also the human 
capabilities. The future sea levels are 
about to increase in the range of 10-
100 cm by 2100, the entire Maldives 
island could be submerged (https:// 
www.worldbank.org/en/news/ 
feature/2010/04/06/climate-change-in-
the-maldives). 
Droughts: Arid regions in South Asia, 
including dry regions of Rajasthan in 
India and some regions of Pakistan, 
are facing severe drought. However, 
due to frequently occurring diﬀerent 
kinds of droughts (late onset, mid-
rd
season and terminal), 2/3  of India's 
agriculture areas are under rain-fed 
condition. Western Rajasthan, parts of 
Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, 
Southern Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, 
Southern Gujarat, Northern parts of 
Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka are 
regularly facing dryness, and these 
regions are highly vulnerable to 
drought (Bhadwal et al., 2007). The 
arid and semi-arid zones are 
vulnerable to the losses of economic 
activities and livelihoods due to the 
changes in rate of precipitation.

that around 68,51,147 people were 
aﬀected due to tidal wave of heavy 
storm of about 150 km/hr with a 20 
feet height (Islam and Nazrul, 2008).   
Economic Losses of Climate 
Change in Agriculture
Economic losses from natural 
disasters are rising globally, and 
agriculture sector is highly vulnerable 
to these disasters. According to the 
United Nations Oﬃce for Disaster 
Risk Reduction (UNISDR) (2018), 
disaster-hit countries experienced 
direct economic losses to the tune of 
US$ 2908 billion during 1998–2017. 
Of the total losses, 77 percent were 
due to climate related disasters. 
Climate change impacts are more 
pronounced on agriculture sector in 
the recent past. Government of India's 
economic survey (2018) estimated 
that the annual loss of US$ 9-10 
billion was due to the adverse eﬀects 
of climate change.  
Climate Change Impacts in 
South Asia and India
Right from the Himalayas to the 
coastal South Asian countries must 
always be prepared to combat the 
eﬀects of global warming (Stern, 
2006). As predicted, the South Asian 
 
zones may experience a warming 
st
eﬀect of 2° to 6° C during the 21  
century (Ravindranath, 2007). 
Speciﬁcally, Indian sub-continent and 
other continents are highly vulnerable 
to all kinds of existing climate change 
issues.
Floods: In 2008, millions of people 
were forced to live in shelter-houses 
in Bihar due to ﬂoods. About 20 
million people faced the similar 
problem in Mumbai in 2005. In Delhi 
and Haryana, millions over worth of 
properties were destroyed when 
Yamuna river was ﬂooded above the 
Heatwaves: Frequency and intensity 
of heatwaves are raising in India 
adversely aﬀecting all allied sectors of 
agriculture including dairy, poultry, 
ﬁshery, etc. Low water availability 
Extreme Events (Cyclones and 
storms): Another troublesome 
indicator of global climate change 
such as storms, cyclones, landslides, 
etc., extremely aﬀect South Asian 
countries. Around nine million people 
in the world were severely aﬀected 
due to the destructive cyclones (UN 
assessment). The super cyclone in 
1999 hit Orissa took toll of over a 
million lives besides properties loss in 
the coastal areas (Ahluwalia and 
Malhotra, 2006). Similar is the case 
with the coastal state of Andhra 
Pradesh during Hud-Hud cyclone in 
2014. 
Melting of glaciers: Future situations 
of South Asia may become adverse 
due to melting of glaciers and snow in 
the Himalayan regions. The 
Himalayan glaciers are rapidly 
coupled with heatwaves have severe 
consequences on food security of the 
country. Drinking water crisis for 
humans and livestock besides drying 
of long-standing horticulture orchards 
was seen. India and its neighbouring 
countries experienced a severe and 
longest heatwave from mid-May to 
mid-June in 2019. Chiru in Rajasthan 
state, India documented a record of 
high temperature up to 50.8° C 
(123.4° F), which is almost missed by 
fraction of degree i.e., 51.0° C 
(123.8° F) highest set in 2016. As of 
12 June 2019, the second largest 
heatwave period (32 days) ever  was 
documented.

Climate Change and  Indian Agriculture: Impacts, Coping Strategies, Programmes and Policy 
'Agriculture' is the main occupation 
for 50 percent of population in India. 
Agriculture and allied sectors 
contribute 15.4 per cent of the Indian 
GDP (OECD, 2017). Farming 
activities are carried out by the 
selection of crop which is speciﬁc to 
suit climate, soil type, resource 
availability, etc. Therefore, farming 
melting down because of high 
temperature and if it continues in 
future, the fresh water stock for 
survival will be at great risk 
(Bajracharya, et.al. 2007). Satellite 
data project that the rate of retreat of 
30 km long Gangotri Glacier in the 
last 30 years has been more than 3 
folds the rate of the past 200 years or 
so (Rao, 2007). 
Sectoral Impacts of Climate 
Change 
production and productivity is 
completely dependent on climatic 
conditions (Srinivasarao et al., 2016a; 
Bal and Minhas, 2017). Weather 
disruptions, like changes in 
temperature, precipitation and solar 
radiation, aﬀect the agriculture 
ecosystem including livestock, arable 
and hydrology sectors. As per the 
global report prediction, a loss of 10-
40 per cent in crop productivity is 
estimated for 2100  
(https://icar.org.in/node/1738). 
Around 70 per cent of South Asian 
people's life is still in rural zones, and 
of 75 per cent of them are poor 
(Ahluwalia and Malhotra, 2006). 
Enhancement of crop productivity is 
highly necessary for safeguarding the 
food and national security, particularly 
the resource-poor who would be the 
most aﬀected, like small and marginal 
farmers (Figure 2).

Climate Change and  Indian Agriculture: Impacts, Coping Strategies, Programmes and Policy 
Livestock, Poultry and Fishery 
sectors: The climate change, whether 
it is global, regional or in a smaller 
scale, has a greater impact on 
biological production, or sum of those 
processes acts directly on individual 
organisms or species. The growth and 
development of any species with 
some speciﬁc characteristics is 
governed by their resilience and 
tolerance to the changes in their 
environment. Global climate changes 
aﬀect numerous factors which are 
associated with production, 
reproduction, health and adaptability 
of every animal. Higher temperatures 
abruptly change the animal's body 
physiology (Pereira et al., 2008) such 
as rise in respiration rates (> 70-
80/minute), blood ﬂow and body 
temperature (>102.5º F). In 
Bangladesh, decrease in livestock 
production due to diseases, lack of 
forage, heat stress and breeding 
strategies resulted in huge economic 
losses (Chowdhury and Monzur, 
2016). The correlation between 
performance of cattle production and 
temperature-humidity index is 
negative (Shinde et al., 1990; Mandal 
et al., 2002). Erratic changes in 
weather conditions directly impact the 
production level of animal by 58 per 
cent and reproduction by 63.3 per cent 
(Singh et al., 2012). Dairy breeds are 
more vulnerable to heat stress than the 
meat breeds. An increase in metabolic 
heat production in higher milk 
producing breeds leads to higher 
cracking in litchi plantation (Kumar 
and Kumar, 2007). Most of the 
vegetable crops are severely aﬀected 
by ﬂooding, particularly tomato. 
Another possibility of causing severe 
damage to crops is due to the 
accumulation of endogenous ethylene 
(Drew, 1979). If the ozone 
concentration reaches to >50 ppb/day, 
yield of vegetable crops will be 
reduced by 5 to 15 percent (Raj, 
2009).
Sector-wise Eﬀects of Climate 
Change in Agriculture
Field crops: An average of 30 per 
cent decrease in crop yields is 
st
expected by mid-21  century in South 
Asian countries. North Indian states 
and Bangladesh are highly susceptible 
due to erratic changes in rainfall and 
temperature (World Bank, 2008). For 
example, in India, an increase in 
temperature by 1.5° C and decrease in 
the precipitation of 2 mm, reduces the 
rice yield by 3 to 15 percent 
(Ahluwalia and Malhotra, 2006). 
Climatic changes driven by increasing 
Green House Gases (GHGs) possibly 
aﬀects the yield and productivity of 
agricultural crops from region to 
region. According to the Met Oﬃce 
(United Kingdom's National Weather 
Service), the normal crop yield is 
anticipated to decrease by 50 per cent 
in Pakistan. The production of maize 
in European countries is expected to 
increase by 25 percent in ideal 
hydrologic conditions 
(en.wikipedia.org). The drastic 
changes in climate alters the 
progressive stages of pathogens that 
eventually aﬀect the growth and 
yields of crops severely, and also 
could lead to an increase in pest and 
insect population, ultimately 
devastating the overall productivity. 
Horticulture: Vegetable crops when 
exposed to extreme high temperatures 
are subject to very high transpiration 
losses, and it also limits fruit setting in 
citrus fruits. High temperature causes 
burning or scorching eﬀect of 
blossoms, predominantly on young 
trees. Fruit setting stage of navel 
oranges is recorded to be severely 
aﬀected by high temperatures during 
ﬂowering (Davies, 1986). High 
temperature induces moisture stress 
condition leading to sunburn and 
cracking symptoms in fruit trees like 
apricot, cherries and apples. The 
temperature enhancement at ripening 
stage causes fruit burning and

'Adaptation led Mitigation' to climate 
change is the only option to prepare 
our community, locality, country, and 
the societies for the consequences of 
same. 'Adaptation' is nothing but the 
adjustments in human or natural 
ecosystem in response to climate 
change, and it moderately harm or 
destruct the opportunities (IPCC, 
2007). Practically, it means changing 
the regular activities because of 
change in climate but not completely 
diﬀerent, rather purposefully 
modifying the existing practice. 
Hence, risk management is a key 
factor of adoption, and it may require 
complex governance processes. While 
'Mitigation' is any technological 
modiﬁcation that reduces the addition 
of inputs and its emission (GHGs into 
atmosphere) per unit of output 
(IPCC). Adaptation in agriculture 
sector means disseminating the 
knowledge on the negative impacts of 
climate change to reduce farmers' 
vulnerability by improving their 
adaptive capacity. However, the 
individual must be accompanied by 
groups, government supportive 
policies, agricultural extension 
services, research and some risk 
management tools. Adaptation and 
adaptation-led-mitigation is the 
central strategy in agriculture sector 
of India, and the same is reﬂected in 
various international forums. 
Adaptation and its Co-
beneåts of Mitigation in 
Agriculture Sector 
susceptibility to heat stress; while the 
low milk producing animals are 
resistant (Dash et al., 2016). Increase 
in temperature and temperature-
humidity index value beyond the 
critical threshold level reduces the dry 
matter intake and milk yield. It also 
interrupts physiology of animal's body 
(West, 2003). During 2009-10, the 
extreme events like ﬂoods and 
cyclones devastated agricultural 
production in large range in southern 
and central Mozambique, 
consequently loss of livestock, its 
infrastructure and feed (Musemwa et 
al., 2012). 
Poultries are extremely sensitive to 
temperature-associated issues, 
speciﬁcally heat stress. 
Endocrinological changes caused by 
prolonged heat stress in broiler 
chickens enhance lipid accumulation, 
reduced lipolysis, and induced amino 
acid catabolism (Geraert et al. 1996). 
Due to heat stress, feed intake of 
poultries will be reduced (Deng et al., 
2012), which leads to less body 
weight, egg production and quality of 
meat, and also reduces the thickness 
of eggshell and increases the egg 
breakage (Lin et al., 2004). Heat 
stress has negative eﬀect on strength, 
weight, ash content and thickness of 
the eggshell (Miller and Sunde, 1975). 
Rising environmental temperature 
may cause seasonal improvement in 
growth and development of ﬁshes, but 
increases the risks to the populations 
living beyond the thermal tolerance 
zone (Morgan et al., 2001). The rise in 
temperature of 1° C will aﬀect the 
mortality of ﬁsh and its geographical 
distribution (Vivekanandan et al., 
2009). The temperature rises of 0.37° 
C to 0.67° C alter the pattern of 
monsoon seasonal variations, 
eventually shifting the breeding 
period of Indian main carps from June 
to March in West Bengal and Orissa's 
ﬁsh hatcheries (DARE/ICAR Annual 
Report, 2008-09).

Combating Climate Change
The eﬀect of change in frequency and 
magnitude of natural disasters on 
agriculture sector is devastating  by 
placing many lives and livelihoods of 
various communities at risk. 
Speciﬁcally, this sector is already 
threatened by land degradation, less 
water availability and biodiversity 
losses became even more vulnerable 
to climate change. Most important 
driver to climate change adaptation is 
technology. Awareness and capacity 
building is critical among all  the 
stakeholders from farmers to policy 
makers for overall climate change 
adaptation (Figure 3 & Figure 4). 
Community-driven programmes and 
village institutions' involvement are 
critical to adapt to climate change 
over to those of individuals. There is a 
strong need to convergence of multi-
ministries' programmes at village or 
mandal level for deriving beneﬁts of 
national or state-level climate 
adaptation programmes.
Adaptation strategies with improved 
farming techniques/practices can

Water Saving Techniques
potentially decrease the vulnerability 
of adverse impacts of climate change. 
Most of the adaptation technologies 
have co-beneﬁts of mitigation by 
removing, reducing or displacing the 
emissions of atmospheric carbon 
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide 
with some co-beneﬁts (FAO, 2012). 
Water management is the critical 
factor for overall climate change 
adaptation in India and elsewhere. 
When water is limited,  the priority 
should go to livestock followed by 
horticulture and then to annual crops 
(Figure 5). Half of the Indian 
agriculture is rain dependent and 
therefore, rain water conservation (in-
situ as well as ex-situ in terms of farm 
or community ponds) is the highly 
prioritised adaptation strategy (Figure 
6). This enables the provision of 
drinking water for livestock sector.

Eﬃcient rice, wheat and sugarcane 
production systems are most 
important for conserving water 
resources. Several land treatments for 
in-situ rain water conservations, 
location-speciﬁc designs of farm 
ponds for harvesting of runoﬀ under 
high intensity rains were made 
available by the Indian Council of 
Agricultural Research (ICAR). 
Livestock is critical for the stability of 
livelihoods of small holder farmers in 
India and other developing countries. 
Three-tier strategy such as better 
breed, feed and shelter management is 
recommended by the ICAR for 
sustainable livestock production. 
Combination of these strategies could 
not only contribute to climate change 
adaptation but also reduce GHG's 
emissions particularly methane. These 
include modifying the feeding habits 
like improvement in forage quality, 
using speciﬁc dietary additives and 
usage of fodder grasses can increase 
the digestive process and eventually 
reduces the emission from enteric 
fermentation (Figure 7). The value of 
diﬀerent feeds as CH  gas production

potential of various livestock feeds, is 
presented in Figure 8. Usage of dry

methane emission. Selection of 
location-suitable aquatic species, 
enhancing feeding eﬃciency, adoption 
of herbivorous and omnivorous 
aquaculture will possibly reduce GHG 
emission from input use besides 
productivity of ﬁsheries. Overall 
strategy of climate change adaptation 
with the implementation of various 
technological interventions is 
illustrated in Figure 9.

The Ministry of Environment, 
Forestry and Climate Change (MoEF 
& CC) is a central government nodal 
agency structured for UNFCCC for 
planning, co-ordination and 
controlling the execution of India's 
environmental and forestry policies 
and programmes with respect to the 
conservation of natural resources, 
biodiversity, forests and wildlife by 
abating the atmosphere pollution 
(http://moef.gov.in/). The UNFCCC is 
a 'Rio Convention' came into 
existence in 1994, designed/aimed to 
prevent all hazardous activities of 
human which interfere the global 
climate. It has a Universal 
Membership of about 197 countries to 
act against climate change issues in 
the interest of human safety by 
stabilizing the green house gas 
concentration in atmosphere 
(https://unfccc.int/portal_espanol/info

The Indian Council of Agricultural 
Research (ICAR) under the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, 
Govt. of India, took proactive role in 
institutionalizing the climate 
adaptation process in the agriculture 
sector. Its initiative to evaluate the 
vulnerability of Indian agriculture to 
global climate change and analysis of 
the adaptation and mitigation 
strategies is amply recognized within 
and across the world. In 2004, ICAR 
launched a National Network Project 
on ''Impacts, Adaptation and 
Vulnerability of Indian Agriculture to 
Climate Change'' to focus on 
India also helped the SAARC partners 
to develop such initiatives. These 
initiatives and experiences were 
amply shared among participating 
countries of UNFCCC process during 
in-session workshops (as listed below 
under Koronivia Joint Work on 
Agriculture (KJWA) section) and 
negotiation process during 2013-2019. 
ICAR also contributed to multi-
ministerial demonstration of climate 
change mitigation initiatives at 
UNFCCC through global climate 
change negotiations in Subsidiary 
Body for Scientiﬁc and Technological 
Advice (SBSTA) and Conference of 
Parties (COP). ICAR has also been 
contributing to reﬁnements in 
measuring climate change through its 
participation of Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as 
illustrated in Figure 10.

sectors like cereal crops, horticulture 
crops, plantation crops, livestock, ﬁsh, 
soil, water, agroforestry, market and 
policy collaborating with 15 industries 
during the X plan (A case study of 
ICAR). A mega project named 
“National Initiatives for Climate 
Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) 
functioned with multi-stakeholder 
participation in order to bring the 
stability of food production through 
climate adaptation and mitigation 
strategies. Large-scale infrastructure 
was established across the country for 
taking up climate change research and 
technology development. India was 
proactive in developing district 
agriculture contingency plans for all 
rural districts towards preparedness 
and real time response to climate 
change impacts.

climate convention which emphasizes 
the key role of agriculture and food 
security in the international climate 
change agenda. The agenda item on 
issues related to agriculture under the 
Subsidiary Body for Scientiﬁc and 
Technological Advice (SBSTA) was 
ﬁrst formalized in 2011 (decision 
2/CP.17), followed by ﬁve in-session 
workshops on the status of scientiﬁc 
knowledge concerning agriculture and 
climate change. Rich exchanges 
among countries paved the way 
towards the KJWA, which calls for 
collaboration between SBSTA and the 
Subsidiary Body of Implementation 
(SBI) on speciﬁc elements, including 
through workshops and expert 
meetings and thus, widening the scope 
of the conversation from a scientiﬁc 
and technical focus to 
implementation. The KJWA decision 
provides a list of speciﬁc elements on 
which Parties are initially invited to 
exchange their views. Under this 
decision, FAO supports countries 
providing technical support to adapt 
to and mitigate climate change, 
working in close collaboration with 
UNFCCC and other partners. Parties 
and observers have been invited to 
submit views by May 6, 2019 on: 
Methods and approaches; for 
assessing adaptation, adaptation co-
beneﬁts and improved soil carbon, 
soil health and soil fertility under 
grassland and cropland as well as 
integrated systems including water 
management.  Workshops related to 
these topics will then be organized at 
th
the 50  sessions of the UNFCCC 
Subsidiary Bodies (SBI50 and SBSTA 
50) during June 17-27, 2019 which 
were listed below along with previous 
in-session workshops.

Sharing the knowledge and technologies for 
climate resilient agriculture in India
SAARC-APN regional consultations on climate resilient policies, 
strategies and programs held at ICAR-NAARM, Hyderabad, 
April, 2018
Besides UNFCCC, regional climate 
policies play a signiﬁcant role towards 
climate adaptation and mitigation co-
beneﬁts. Various climate adaptation 
strategies, programmes and policies of 
Agriculture sector of SAARC 
countries (India, Sri lanka, Nepal, 
Bhutan, Maldives, Bangladesh and 
Pakistan) were discussed at the 
National Academy of Agricultural 
Research Management (ICAR-
NAARM), Hyderabad during April, 
2018 in order to share the knowledge 
and implement programmes of 
Climate Change Adaptation in the 
respective countries (source: ICAR 
website). This consultation workshop 
was organized for SAARC Country 
representatives under South Asian 
Association for Regional Cooperation 
(SAARC) and Asia Paciﬁc Network 
for Global Change Research (APN). 
SAARC countries are highly 
vulnerable due to its tropical climate, 
long sea coast or island ecosystem etc. 
Key strategies and way forward in the 
form of key messages originated from 
these workshops are; a) Promoting, 
training and capacity building among 
regional countries; b) Contingency 
plan implementation process; c) Agro-
advisories; d) Soil health and carbon 
sequestration; e) Livestock feed 
management; f) Minimizing coastal 
vulnerability and g) Innovative village 
institutions .

Climate Change and  Indian Agriculture: Impacts, Coping Strategies, Programmes and Policy 
18
Not only has the national action 
planned executing schemes to 
mitigate the global climate change, 
rather the State Governments of India 
also working on it. The State Action 
Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) is a 
ﬂexible and dynamic policy 
framework follows a continuous 
interaction process for bringing 
changes in national, state and local 
levels. It was directed by National 
Government to create a coherent 
national framework under the line of 
NAPCC. The Govt. of Maharashtra 
targeted to stabilize the income of 83 
per cent of the rainfed and dryland 
farmers under this Scheme covering 
the major areas such as farm 
mechanization, protected cultivation, 
creation of irrigation potential, 
processing and marketing and human 
resource development as well 
(www.mahades.maharashtra.gov.in/M
PSIMS).  Further, Maharashtra took 
the lead scale to bring the stability of 
agriculture systems in the state. 
Similarly, the Government of 
Karnataka initiated State Rainfed 
Farming Mission for adaptation of 
large rainfed tracts of the state for 
drought conditions. Government of 
Andhra Pradesh initiated Neeru-
Chettu for greening the state, besides 
million farm ponds for climate change 
adaptation for vulnerable regions of 
the state. Mission Kakateeya in 
Telangana showed the positive 
impacts of water conservation, soil 
health and enhanced greening. Large 
scale farm ponds in the state of 
Rajasthan contributed to critical 
irrigation during mid-season droughts. 
Similarly, several other states initiated 
climate adaptation programs covering 
diﬀerent sub-sectors of agriculture. 
State Government 
Initiatives for Climate 
Change Adaptation
ICAR supported in the technical 
backstopping and large-scale 
awareness in all the regions of the 
country towards climate change 
adaptation and co-beneﬁts derived 
through adaptation process 
(Srinivasarao et al., 2016a). 
Impacts of Irrigation policies: 
During the last 20 years in South Asia, 
the ground water resources have been 
developed in all the countries. The 
average productivity of paddy, wheat, 
corn and groundnut has increased 
from 2.32 to 2.97 metric tons 
(Mt)/hectare. Irrigation, generated 
additional food of 24 million metric 
tons, which eventually reduced GHGs 
emission by 7 Mt carbon dioxide 
equivalent (CO e). Minimizing the 
2
GHGs emission by avoiding 
conversion of forest lands to cropland 
is estimated at 68.14 Mt CO e. The 
2
energy usage for pumping ground 
water has produced 30.5 Mt CO e of 
2
GHGs, resulting the negative balance 
of 47.8 Mt CO e (mitigation beneﬁt). 
2
Micro type irrigation smart 
technologies have a triple beneﬁt, 
which saves water, energy and 
increases overall yield. Almost, 20-45 
per cent worldwide increase in 
production reported from micro-
irrigation. The estimated 30 per cent 
increase in eﬃciency yielded 
additional production of 3.48 Mt by 
saving 0.73 million hectare meters of 
water, thereby, reducing emission of 
5.65 Mt CO e (Joshi and Tyagi, 2017). 
2
“More crop per Drop” is a strong 
message in overall water utilization 
strategy in Indian agriculture. The 
Prime Minister Krishi Sinchayee 
Yojana (PMSKY) besides 
MGNREGA have contributed 
immensely for water resources 
conservation and ground water 
recharge and utilization in the country.  
Impacts of National 
Programmes and Policies 
19
Climate Change and  Indian Agriculture: Impacts, Coping Strategies, Programmes and Policy 
Agro-forestry Policy: Forestry and 
agro-forestry policy of the Govt. of 
India have greater role in climate 
adaptation and mitigation. Area under 
agro-forestry is on upward trend 
towards more carbon ﬁxation and 
reduced GHGs. Inclusion of pricing 
policy would contribute to stability of 
livelihoods of agro-forestry farmers of 
India besides environmental services. 
Location-speciﬁc agro-forestry 
species identiﬁcation along with 
associated technology was promoted 
by ICAR through its network. 
Both ﬁeld crops and horticulture sub-
sectors positively impacted with 
improved water use eﬃciency related 
programmes and policies. 
Impacts of Fertilizer Policies: The 
rate of consumption of fertilizer has 
grown rapidly in South Asian 
countries. The fertilizer policies in 
India has grown positively by 
enhancing crop production and 
productivity. The additional food 
grain production of 13.66 Mt using 
fertilizers avoided the conversion of 
11.48 million hectares of forestland to 
cropland, thereby, reducing 2013 Mt 
of GHGs emissions (Joshi and Tyagi, 
2017). Soil Health Card mission of 
the Govt. of India has a great potential 
for not only improved productivity 
but also for need-based nutrient 
application, and improved soil health 
which contribute to climate change 
adaptation. Neem coated urea is 
another important step by the National 
Government leading to reduced 
fertilizer input cost, improved nutrient 
use eﬃciency and reduced GHGs 
from fertilizer nutrient sources. 
Livestock, Poultry and Fishery 
Sector Policies: The Department of 
Agriculture and Allied sectors has 
been providing assistance to the State 
Governments for the control of animal 
diseases, scientiﬁc management and 
upgradation of genetic resources, 
increasing availability of nutritious 
Contingency Plans and Resilient 
Model Villages: The major impacts 
of agriculture contingency plans and 
climate resilient villages established 
by ICAR are: a) Large-scale 
awareness created from diﬀerent 
hierarchy besides capacity building to 
about million stakeholders involved in 
resilient agriculture through 
preparedness workshops, interface 
meetings, village institutions, ﬁeld 
visits etc.; b) seed systems and farm 
machinery through Custom Hiring 
Centres for timely sowing and farm 
operations established; c) prioritised 
technologies required for resilient 
agriculture implemented for example 
in Madhya Pradesh, and crops were 
saved through rain gun-based 
lifesaving irrigation in Andhra 
Pradesh; d) sowing area reduction was 
oﬀ-set during drought years region 
(2014, 2015, 2016) to the extent of 6-
9 percent. One hundred ﬁfty-one 
resilient villages established by ICAR 
are being replicated in the state 
Government programmes. Village 
carbon balance computed through 
implementation of climate resilient 
villages was enhanced oﬀ setting 
GHG emissions (Srinivasarao et al., 
2016b). This is the one of the 
feed and fodder, sustainable 
development of processing and 
marketing facilities, and enhancement 
of production and proﬁtability of 
livestock and ﬁsheries enterprises. 
During 2017-18, the record milk 
production was registered at 176.3 mt 
in comparison with 132.4 mt during 
2012-13. Several livestock related 
policies contributed to animal health, 
vaccination, fodder availability, 
artiﬁcial insemination besides 
marketing and promotion 
agripreneurship ecosystems in India. 
During the ﬁnancial year 2017-18, the 
total ﬁsh production in India is 
estimated at 12.61 Million Metric 
tonnes. Similar advances were made 
in poultry sectors.

Insurance Policies: Insurance 
policies have been introduced and 
revisited in the interest of the farmers 
to reduce distress and preparedness 
compensation. Though registrations 
are at moderate level, there is ample 
opportunity to strengthen the 
agriculture insurance under the Prime 
Minister Crop Insurance Scheme. Lot 
of value addition to the insurance 
policy was done besides premium 
reduction.  
important initiative implemented at 
the ground level by multi- stakeholder 
involvement with strong technical 
support and scientiﬁc knowledge ﬂow 
besides systematic monitoring.  
Agriculture and Rural Development 
Ministries Aggregated: In 2019, the 
Government of India had taken the 
decision to bring two important 
Ministries such as Agriculture and 
Rural Development headed by a 
single Minister. This is another 
important step contributing that 
climate change adaptation 
technologies are implemented in 
holistic way at the village level as 
adaptation process is community 
driven. With aggregating two

Climate Change and  Indian Agriculture: Impacts, Coping Strategies, Programmes and Policy 
Global climate change, its causes and impacts are one of the most emerging 
issues in science and technology domain. India, a tropical country, is facing 
its impacts through droughts, ﬂoods, cyclones, heat waves, hailstorms, and 
coastal salinity which have become threats to sustainable development. 
About 70 per cent of the Indian population is directly or indirectly 
associated with agriculture and sub-sectors, and major Sustainability 
Development Goals (SDGs) are expected to be met from this sector. 
Increasing global temperature due to the emission of enormous amount of 
green-house gases from various sources is the cause of climate change and 
impacts. Extreme temperature and its erratic events disrupt the activities of 
all the existing lives on the planet by means of severe damage or loss. 
Assessment of the impacts and a comprehensive understanding of the 
beneﬁts of adaptation options over combating the uncommon incidents of 
climate change is pivotal in the current scenario to sustain life. So far in the 
journey of Indian agriculture sector, climate adaptation strategies have 
shown positive impacts. Still much more needed in the light of emerging 
Conclusions 
Climate Change and  Indian Agriculture: Impacts, Coping Strategies, Programmes and Policy 
22
Recommendations 
3. 
Diﬀerential and better incentive mechanisms to the farmers and practitioners who 
practice Good Agriculture Practices (GAP) related to water and fertilizer saving, 
residue recycling and integrated farming systems. They can be done by water use 
monitoring system in the ﬁeld and fertilizer use monitoring at sole points. 
1. 
Preparation of nations to compensate these changes requires intensive and inclusive 
steps for mitigation by adaptation of innovative practices. Commitment to achieve the 
goal of sustainable agriculture and to create eco-friendly environment within our 
community must be strengthened by the adaptation strategies. Large-scale climate 
awareness is a must, and should be taken forward by multi-ministerial platforms.
5. 
Nevertheless, continuous monitoring and evaluation of the adaptation measures ease 
the understanding level, and also enables further needed alterations of such measures.
4. 
Impacts of several national and state-level climate action programmes and policies by 
academic institutions should be taken up and need-based changes be made based on 
these impact studies. 
2. 
Reduced food losses should be considered as one of the greatest climate change 
mitigation action. Besides creating awareness accounting of food losses should be 
taken up by Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Rural Development with 
Civil Supplies, Ministry of Civil Aviation and other Ministries related to food 
production and distribution.
12. Overall objectivity of future agriculture in India and elsewhere, is to have food 
production stability and its enhancement despite of climate change with its impacts 
with enhanced eﬃciency and lower carbon foot print. 
11. Quantiﬁcation of impacts should be made mandatory in project sanctioning 
mechanisms.  
6. 
A strategic approach of both central and state programmes on climate change 
mitigation is crucial to progress the adaptive ability by addressing the existing climate 
risks and its future vulnerabilities. Intensive and a comprehensive programme is 
essential with collective responsibilities and climate actions under NAPCC and 
SAPCC.
7. 
Lack of data on the rate of adaptation and the existing knowledge-level imposes 
further limits on evaluation of global climate change and its future risks. Much more 
location-speciﬁc research is necessary to develop innovative way of adaptive 
measures and co-beneﬁts of mitigation for reduced green-house gas emission in the 
sector. 
10. National adaptation fund sponsored projects need to be region speciﬁc. Package of 
climate adaptive technologies implemented under these projects should be monitored 
by the experts and needful guidance to be taken periodically for better 
implementation. 
8. 
Aggregation of Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Ministry of Rural 
Development contributes to the eﬀective implementation of several national and also 
state programmes in synergistic way. 
9. 
Besides, action plans should be drawn and collected to be promoted by all the 
Ministries at the village as a unit, be it the Ministry of Water Resources, Animal 
Husbandry and Fishery, Earth Sciences, Environment, Forestry and Climate Change 
along with Ministry of Agriculture Farmers Welfare and Rural Development.
