There is now adequate evidence about the impending climate change and the consequences thereof. The
fourth assessment report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) observed that ‘warming
of climate system is now unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average
air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global sea level’ and the
atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased from the pre-industrial levels of 280 to
379 ppm in 2005 (IPCC, 2007) and to around 392.5 ppm during 2012 (Bala, 2013). Climate change is
probably the most complex and challenging environmental problem facing the world today (Ojwang’ et al.,
2010) and is increasingly recognized as a potent threat to agriculture in general and to food security in
particular. The IPCC defines climate change as “a change in the state of the climate that can be identified
(e.g., using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or variability of its properties, and that persists
for an extended period, typically decades or longer” (IPCC, 2007). This definition, unlike the one given by
the UNFCCC, does not distinguish the change in climate over time due to natural variability or due to
anthropogenic activity. Although climate change is global in its occurrence and consequences, it is the
developing countries like India that face more adverse consequences. Globally, climate change is seen as
a failure of market mechanisms wherein the polluters haven’t had to pay for the negative externalities
(Stern, 2007).
Climate change projections made for India indicate an overall increase in temperature by 1 to 40C and
precipitation by 9-16% towards 2050s (Krishna Kumar et al., 2011). However, different regions are expected
to experience differential change in the amount of rainfall that is likely to be received in the coming
decades. Another significant aspect of climate change is the increase in the frequency of occurrence of
extreme events such as droughts, floods and cyclones. All of these expected changes will have adverse
impacts on climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture, forest and coastal ecosystems and also on
availability of water for different uses and on human health. Historical trends also show a noticeable
increase in mean temperature in the country though there is no discernible trend in the rainfall during the
last several decades. However, regional variation in behaviour of monsoon rainfall was observed over the
years.
The international negotiations on climate change have now rightly recognized that adaptation is as
important as mitigation in dealing with climate change as the world is already committed to certain extent
of climate change and even the fullest possible mitigation efforts will not prevent the projected rise in
temperature till 2100. Therefore, adaptation measures to deal with climate variability and change need
greater attention in terms of policy, research and institutional interventions. In order to develop and target
appropriate adaptation measures, it is important to identify regions that are relatively more affected by
climate change. This ‘identification process involves assessment of vulnerability of different regions’
(Acosta-Michlik et al., 2005).
Keeping the need to make Indian agriculture more resilient to changing and increasingly variable climate,
the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) launched a megaproject “National Initiative on Climate
Resilient Agriculture (NICRA)” during February 2011. This initiative, being coordinated by CRIDA, Hyderabad,
is a collaborative and participatory effort by a number of institutes addressing the specific sub-sectors
2
within agriculture. In order to develop and target appropriate adaptation measures, it is important to
identify regions that are more affected by climate change. Hence, assessment of vulnerability of different
regions was taken up as an important activity under NICRA. This publication presents the analysis of
vulnerability of agriculture to climate change and variability at the district level considering the fact that
most of the development planning and programme implementation is done at district level in India. Also,
most of the non-climatic data that is integral to assessment of vulnerability to climate change and
adaptation planning is also available at district level. Thus, this Atlas is useful in identifying the districts
that are relatively more vulnerable to climate change so that the necessary investments can be targeted
better. It is also useful in identifying sources of vulnerability that are critical to developing appropriate
adaptation measures in terms of technologies, investments and policies.

‘Vulnerability’ has emerged as a cross-cutting multidisciplinary theme of research in the current context
characterized by rapid changes in the environmental, economic and social systems. Accordingly, vulnerability
is viewed differently by different individuals and organizations depending on the context in which they operate.
For example, vulnerability is viewed as susceptibility to a natural hazard or refers to the frequency of
occurrence of a hazard in the literature related to disaster management. As opposed to this, development
economics views vulnerability as the propensity of the entity to face a negative outcome in terms of poverty,
food insecurity or loss of welfare and does not always link this negative outcome to a specific risk. In the
context of climate change and agriculture, vulnerability refers to the propensity of the entity to face a climate
shock and suffer loss in production and/ or income from agriculture, though the latter is not always specified
explicitly (Kavi Kumar et al., 2007). Vulnerability is essentially an ex ante concept and refers to the possibility
of being hit or propensity to be harmed by a stress or shock (Ionescu et al., 2008).
Earlier studies on vulnerability assessment viewed vulnerability more as a biophysical impact of climate
change. These impact assessments ‘superimpose future climate scenarios on an otherwise constant
world to estimate the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on a climate-sensitive system’
(Fussel and Klein, 2006). The emphasis gradually shifted to derive policy lessons from vulnerability
assessment as the purpose of such assessment was to identify strategies that reduce vulnerability of the
systems or populations concerned. Recent studies on vulnerability recognize the importance of non-climatic
factors in dealing with climate change. Vulnerability in climate change context is generally related to the
residual impact of climate change after accounting for the (autonomous) adaptation. There are three
major approaches to analysis of vulnerability to climate change:
Socio-economic approach: This mainly focuses on socio-economic and political status of individuals or
social groups that vary in terms of education, wealth, health status, access to resources (credit, information,
etc), social capital and so on. This approach holds these variations responsible for differential vulnerability
levels (e.g. Adger and Kelly, 1999). Here, vulnerability is considered as a ‘starting point or state’ of the
system before it encounters the hazard event.
Biophysical approach: This approach assesses the level of damage that a given environmental stress
causes to both social and biological systems and is generally identified with impact assessment or hazard-
loss relationship. As opposed to the socio-economic approach, this focuses on the ‘end point’. In the
context of crop production, this involves simulating or modelling how crop yields change under conditions
that characterize climate variability or climate change (e.g. Olsen et al., 2000; Pathak and Wassmann,
2009; Boomiraj et al, 2010; Srivastava et al., 2010, Abdul Harris et al., 2013).
Integrated approach: This combines both socio-economic and biophysical approaches to determine
vulnerability. The IPCC definition of vulnerability (“The degree to which a system is susceptible to, or
unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes.
Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is
exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity” (McCarthy et al., 2001)) accommodates this approach
to vulnerability analysis. According to this definition, vulnerability has three components – adaptive capacity,
sensitivity and exposure.
Sensitivity is defined as “the degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by
climate-related stimuli”. It is determined by demographic and environmental conditions of the region
4
concerned. Exposure is defined as “the nature and degree to which a system is exposed to significant
climatic variations”. Thus, exposure relates to climate stress upon a particular unit of analysis (Gbetibouo
and Ringler 2009). “A more complete measure of exposure to future climate change would require
consideration of projected changes in climate in each analysis unit” (Eriyagama et al., 2012). Adaptive
capacity is “the ability of a system to adjust to climate change, including climate variability and extremes,
to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences. It
is considered to be “a function of wealth, technology, education, information, skills, infrastructure, access
to resources, stability and management capabilities” (McCarthy et al., 2001)
 In this framework, adaptive capacity is largely consistent with socio-economic approach and sensitivity
with biophysical approach and both are internal dimensions. The component of exposure is viewed as an
external dimension. While higher exposure and sensitivity mean higher vulnerability, adaptive capacity
moderates vulnerability and hence is inversely related to vulnerability. Although lack of standard methods
for combining the biophysical and socio-economic indicators is a limitation to this approach, it can be
helpful in making policy decisions (Deressa et al., 2008).
Though there are different methods and approaches for assessing the vulnerability, selection of a particular
method is determined by the context, purpose and scale of analysis as well as by the availability of
appropriate data. We have adopted the ‘indicator method’ to construct the vulnerability of agriculture to
climate change and variability at the district level.
Because of its transparency, this method was followed in many studies that assessed vulnerability. Deressa
et al (2008) ranked the seven Ethiopian states based on vulnerability indices constructed following the
integrated approach. Eriyagama et al (2012) analysed the relative vulnerability of districts in Sri Lanka
using historical data on the indicators related to the three components of vulnerability. Studies on
vulnerability to climate change in India are limited (Panda, 2009). O’Brien et al (2004) assessed the
vulnerability of different districts in India to climate change and to trade globalization following the
integrated approach. They identified districts that were relatively more vulnerable to climate change, to
globalization of agricultural trade and to both. They have used the climate projections for the period
2071-99 made using the HaDRM 2 climate model output. Palanisami et al (2008) assessed the vulnerability
of districts in Tamilnadu to climate change. They used indicators that represent demographic, agricultural
and technological development and constructed vulnerability index for different agro-climatic regions and
districts in Tamilnadu. This approach broadly classifies the indicators into those related to physical, natural,
human and financial resource endowments that determine the livelihood outcomes. Some studies such
as Kavi Kumar and Tholkiappan (2006) assessed vulnerability of coastal districts by combining a number
of indicators related to adaptive capacity, sensitivity and exposure. Palanisami et al (2010) assessed the
vulnerability of districts in the Krishna-Godavari basin based on indicators related to agriculture,
demography, etc. Ravindranath et al (2011) assessed the vulnerability of districts in North-Eastern states
by constructing separate vulnerability indices for agriculture, forestry and water sectors. They incorporated
the data on climate projections into models that predict the forest cover which were then included in the
construction of vulnerability index following the IPCC framework.
This study combines, compared to the earlier studies, a richer set of indicators to construct the relative
vulnerability index for ranking the districts. Unlike most of the earlier studies, this study incorporates the
climate projections. Also, the climatic projections are converted into agriculturally relevant indicators/
variables such as incidence of dry spells, distribution of rainfall, etc. which would be more useful in
planning technology development and policy formulation for adaptation. This Atlas will help Government
of India and the respective state governments plan for investment in climate resilient agriculture by
focussing on the particular components which make the region/ district more vulnerable than others. The
study is also more comprehensive as it covers 572 rural districts in the country.

As mentioned earlier, the definition of vulnerability given by IPCC is adopted in this study. According to
this, vulnerability is a function of the extent and degree to which an entity is exposed, the sensitivity of the
entity to climate change and the adaptive capacity to adapt to and cope with the changing climate.
Considering that vulnerability intends to capture the residual impact of climate change after accounting
for autonomous adaptation (Fussel and Klein, 2006) that farmers undertake and the difficulties involved
in quantifying the potential and residual impacts at the district level, indicator method1 was chosen to
assess vulnerability of agriculture to climate change at the district level. Indicators are those variables
that reflect the underlying phenomenon of interest. It is this ‘significance’ to the phenomenon/ issue
being addressed that makes an indicator out of a variable. Further, the indicators ideally should have a
monotonic relationship with the underlying phenomenon over a reasonable range of values that they may
take.
3.1. Selection of indicators
In the present context, the three components of vulnerability – sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity
– are represented through a number of indicators that would reflect these components. These indicators
were chosen from a broader list of indicators based on review of literature, discussions with the experts
and nature of relationship with the three components of vulnerability. It may be noted here that inclusion
of indicators into dimensions of sensitivity or adaptive capacity is relatively more difficult and subjective
(Kavi Kumar and Viswanathan, 2006). We have considered those indicators that determine the extent
and intensity of the possible effect of climate change and/or variability as reflecting sensitivity. Thus, the
variables like net sown area, rural population density (see table 1) determine the ‘extent’ of the problem
while the indicators such as water holding capacity of soils, stage of ground water development, frequency
and intensity of occurrence of climate shocks determine the intensity or degree of effect of such shock.
Similarly, variables/ indicators that are relatively more responsive to policy measures are included in the
adaptive capacity2. The determinants of exposure are derived from climate projections as done in previous
studies such as O’brien et al (2004), Deressa et al (2008), Ravindranath et al (2011).

All these indicators are computed using the daily data on rainfall, maximum temperature and minimum
temperature as obtained from PRECIS for SRES A1B4,5. These data are available for 0.44 X 0.440 grids.
Using these grid data the district level estimates are arrived at by taking a simple average of all the grids
falling in any given district in case of temperature and by taking a weighted average of the same with the
area under each grid passing through the district as weight in case of rainfall.

3.2. Computation of Vulnerability Index
A database of all the indicators chosen for 572 rural districts, as appearing in 2001 census was created.
The data on the indicators chosen were then normalized and combined into an index following the
methodology followed in computation of Human Development Index7 (UNDP, 1999, 2006). However, it
differs from it in that the minimum and maximum of the indicator values are taken from the data set
rather than fixing the minimum and maximum values on a priori considerations. In case of rainfall, the
maximum value is fixed at 1500 mm as most crops do not respond positively to rainfall above this. Similarly,
maximum values were defined for fertilizer consumption (400 kg/ha) and number of markets (40).
The process of construction of vulnerability index involves normalization of all the indicators and then
averaging these resultant normalized values. The following formulae were used to normalize different
indicators depending on the relationship of the indicator with the dimension:
When the indicator is positively related to the index
When the indicator is negatively related to the index
Where
Zi is normalized value of ith district w.r.t. the indicator X
Xi is the value of indicator in original units for ith district
Xmin is the minimum value of the indicator in original units across the districts
Xmax is the maximum value of the indicator in original units across the districts (unless specified
on a priori basis)
Three indices for sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity were constructed by obtaining a weighted
mean of the indicators identified. These three indices were then averaged (with differential weights) to
obtain the vulnerability index, higher values of which indicate higher vulnerability and lower values lower
vulnerability. It is to be noted that this index is not an absolute measure of damage or risk due to climate
change and it is only a relative measure of risk between the districts. It is however helpful in targeting and
prioritization of investments for adaptation.
The weights given to each of the indicators were arrived at based on review of literature and a series of
discussions with a group of experts actively involved in research for developing appropriate adaptation
and mitigation measures and strategies to deal with climate change. Table 4 presents the weighting
scheme followed in the computation of vulnerability index.
These results were also found in agreement with the results obtained using the weights derived by
subjecting the data to principal components analysis. The findings were presented to relevant stakeholders
before finalizing the output8. All 572 districts were categorized into five equal quintiles of 114 districts
each and one district at the margin was added to the two more vulnerable categories. Thus, five categories
of districts with – Very High Vulnerability (115), High Vulnerability (115), Medium Vulnerability (114), Low
Vulnerability (114) and Very Low Vulnerability (114) were identified. Further, the most important factors
contributing to vulnerability were identified based on the normalized values of all the indicators and
weights from each of the three dimensions given in case of districts with high and very high vulnerability
so that appropriate interventions can be planned to minimize the vulnerability.

3.3. Variants of Vulnerability Index Computed
Considering the uncertainty associated with climate projections, it may not be entirely desirable to derive
the relative vulnerability based on the output of any single climate projection model. It is useful to construct
the vulnerability index sans the climate projections so that one can obtain an idea as to how different
districts are predisposed to climate change and variability. Thus, vulnerability index was also constructed
by including only those indicators related to sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Thus, three variants of
vulnerability index were constructed:
1. Vulnerability based on the indicators for sensitivity and adaptive capacity
2. Vulnerability based on the indicators related to sensitivity, adaptive capacity and exposure with the
latter capturing the projected changes in climate for the period 2021-50 relative to the baseline (1961-
90)
13
3. Vulnerability based on the indicators related to sensitivity, adaptive capacity and exposure with the
latter capturing the projected changes in climate for the period 2071-98 relative to the baseline (1961-
90)
These three variants are referred to as vulnerability, vulnerability (mid-century) and vulnerability (end-
century), respectively in the remaining part of this publication. State-wise distribution of districts with
different levels of vulnerability, identification of important sources of vulnerability and possible interventions
are, however, done based on the relative vulnerability (mid-century).
3.4. Other Indicators
In addition to providing a measure of relative vulnerability index as explained above, it is considered
useful to present some other variables that are relevant to planning adaptation. Thus, information on the
following variables/ indicators is also presented:
Rainfall per rainy day
Measured in terms of millimetres of rain per rainy day, it is an indicator of rainfall intensity as well as of
distribution of rainfall, especially when considered along with total rainfall. A higher value without a
corresponding increase in the total rainfall indicates unfavourable distribution of rainfall. It is presented
in terms of change during 2021-50 and 2071-98 relative to 1961-90.
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
The status of vegetation in a given locality is influenced by the climatic features of that location. NDVI is a
measure of biomass or vegetation status computed using the remotely sensed data. The variations in
NDVI over time are known to be related to variability in climate especially with temperature and rainfall.
Therefore, the temporal variability in NDVI was captured to understand the variability of climate during
the recent past in the country9.
NDVI (AVHRR)
To identify vulnerable regions in the country, temporal analysis of dynamics of weather aberrations was
carried out for each year. First, a layer of annual Max NDVI for each year was prepared from AVHRR (8-km)
NDVI data product using 24 images for each of the 25 years (1982-2006). Next, they were stacked to
estimate CV of Max NDVI which was then used to plot a variability map using pixel-level data at State and
AESR-levels
NDVI (MODIS)
In addition to AVHRR data, MODIS (16-day 250m) NDVI data product was used to downscale vulnerability
analysis to district-level so that it can help in implementing mitigation and adaptation strategies at the
administrative-level.
14
As mentioned, the analysis was done for the 572 rural districts as appearing in the 2001 Census of India.
Each Union Territory included in the analysis was considered as a single district. Since the vulnerability
index constructed is relative in nature, considering all the districts that vary widely with respect to the
indicators chosen together will mean that the indicator is linearly related to the underlying phenomenon
which may not be the case in reality. For example, the annual rainfall ranges from about 155 mm in
Jaisalmer (Rajasthan) to about 12000 mm in Jantia Hills (Meghalaya). A significant positive deviation in
rainfall may mean less vulnerability in a district with low mean rainfall and a similar deviation may lead to
increased vulnerability in regions with very high mean annual rainfall. However, wherever appropriate, we
have imposed the upper and lower limits so that the non-linearity issue is addressed to some extent and
the bias reduced to that extent. Climate projections for the country vary with the corresponding GCM/
RCMs and with different emission scenarios assumed. We have used only one model projection (A1B
SRES scenario). This scenario was used as it showed ‘reasonable skill in simulating the monsoon climate
over India’ (Krishna Kumar et al., 2011) and was considered as ‘the most appropriate scenario as it
represents high technological development, with the infusion of renewable energy technologies following
a sustainable growth trajectory’ (MoEF, 2012). Further, for a study of this scale, obtaining data on all the
variables/ indicators for a uniform reference period is extremely difficult. For most of the status variables
like irrigation, net sown area, electrification, district domestic product, etc. we have used the most recent
data available for each unit of analysis unless specified otherwise. The missing data were computed
following appropriate methods such as using nearest neighbourhood value, average value of respective
state, etc. The country has witnessed reorganization of districts several times and we have limited our
analysis for the districts as appearing in 2001 and those districts that have been formed since then could
not be explicitly included in this analysis as some of the indicators chosen were derived based on the time
series data.
15
This section presents the data on indicators of different dimensions of vulnerability, the indices of sensitivity,
exposure and adaptive capacity and the vulnerability index. An analysis of variability in the climate in the
recent past in terms of the variability in NDVI is also presented here. The relative rankings of districts
based on the vulnerability index and on the indices of the three components are given in Annexure.
5.1 Sensitivity indicators
Net sown area as proportion of geographical area (Fig. S1): NSA is relatively less in the hill states of
Jammu & Kashmir, North Eastern states and in a few districts in Rajasthan and Gujarat. It is relatively
high in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, Maharashtra and a few districts in Gujarat. Districts with more of area
under agriculture are more sensitive as it indicates that more area is subjected to changing climate and
variability.
Degraded and waste lands (Fig. S2): It indicates the extent of land degraded due to different
forms of erosion, salinity and alkalinity etc. Because of their poor status in terms of physical,
chemical, biological and hydrological attributes, they render crop production highly sensitive to the
changing climate. Large tracts of degraded land are present in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,
and North Eastern States. The problem is relatively low in Bihar, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand
etc.
Annual rainfall (Fig. S3): Higher rainfall is generally considered as favourable to higher agricultural
productivity and production. However, a very high rainfall may as well lead to more erosion and to higher
incidence of floods. Rainfall is typically higher in Western Ghats, Eastern and North Eastern India and low
in Gujarat and Rajasthan where the climate is arid. The tracts comprising states of Maharashtra, Madhya
Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamilnadu and Andhra Pradesh represent a semi-arid climate with rainfall ranging
from 700 to 1300 mm.
Cyclone proneness (Fig. S4): It is an index computed based on five attributes viz., number of cyclones
crossing the district, number of severe cyclones crossing the district, probable maximum rainfall for a day,
probable maximum winds in knot, and probable maximum storm surge. The index is computed for all the
districts on the sea coast. The districts along the west coast, except those in Gujarat, are relatively less
cyclone-prone compared to those on the east coast.
Area prone to flood incidence (Fig. S5): More than 20 per cent of geographical area is prone to incidence
of floods in a majority of districts in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and in a few
districts in North-Eastern states, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Orissa.
Drought incidence (Fig. S6): Very high incidence of drought (> 20%) is observed in a few districts in
Rajasthan and Gujarat. The incidence is relatively low in the Western Ghats, Eastern and North-Eastern
India.
16
Available water holding capacity of soil (Fig. S7): A low capacity of soil to hold water that the plants can
take means higher sensitivity of crop yields to variable and changing climate. It is more than 100 mm in
most of the districts and is relatively low (< 60 mm) in Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh,
North-Eastern states and a few districts in Rajasthan.
Stage of groundwater development (Fig. S8): This indicates the draft of groundwater relative to availability.
The situation with respect to ground water is precarious in a majority of districts in Rajasthan, Punjab,
Haryana and in a few districts in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamilnadu and Madhya Pradesh
where more than 100 per cent of available groundwater is already being used.
Rural population density (Fig. S9): This indicates the degree of dependence of population on agriculture
and hence higher the density more is the sensitivity. A higher density also means higher man-land ratio
indicating the low per capita availability of land. Districts in eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West
Bengal and Kerala have rural population density of more than 600/km2. In a majority of the districts in
the country, the rural population density is less than 400/km2.
Small and marginal farmers (Fig. S10): This is closely related to rural population density and is also an
indicator of distribution of land. More than 60 per cent of land is owned by small and marginal farmers in
Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Uttrakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamilnadu, Orissa
and in a few districts in Andhra Pradesh and North-Eastern states.
Sensitivity Index (Fig. S11): Most of the districts in north-west India have very high sensitivity
and those in the Indo-Gangetic plains of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal exhibit high sensitivity.
Similarly, a number of districts in peninsular semi-arid regions are also highly sensitive. Sensitivity is
found to be relatively low in the eastern, north-eastern, northern parts and along the west coast of the
country.
5.2 Exposure indicators
5.2.1. Exposure (Mid-century relative to baseline)
Change in annual rainfall (Fig. EM1): Rainfall is projected to increase or to remain constant in a majority
of districts except in a few districts in Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh,
Karnataka and Tamilnadu.
Change in rainfall during June (Fig. EM2): Rainfall during June is critical to sowing of most of rainy
season crops and hence as such is a key determinant of cropping pattern. This is projected to decrease in
majority of districts in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Tamilnadu
and in a few districts in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and North-Eastern states.
Change in rainfall during July (Fig. EM3): Rainfall during July is projected to increase or remain the same
in a majority of districts, Some districts in Rajasthan, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, West
Bengal and North-Eastern states are, however, expected to receive less rainfall during July.
Change in number of rainy days (Fig. EM4): Number of rainy days is an indicator of distribution of rainfall
when seen with the amount of rainfall during a year. No considerable change in the number of rainy days
is likely in a majority of districts. The rainfall is expected to be received in fewer days in some districts of
Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, North-Eastern states, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, southern Maharashtra
17
and Tamilnadu. A few districts in north-western parts of the country, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa are likely
to experience more rainy days.
Change in maximum temperature (Fig. EM5): Except for Punjab, Haryana and a few districts in Rajasthan,
maximum temperature is likely to rise by more than 1.50C in rest of the country. A few districts in Bihar,
West Bengal, Jharkhand, North-Eastern states, Himachal Pradesh, Uttrakhand and Karnataka are likely
to experience much hotter days with the rise in maximum temperature exceeding 20C.
Change in minimum temperature (Fig. EM6): The minimum temperature is expected to increase by 2 –
2.50C in most districts with the rise being somewhat moderate (1.5 – 2.00C) in the eastern and north-
eastern states. The nights are projected to be much warmer (by >2.50C) in Jammu & Kashmir.
Change in incidence of extremely hot days (Fig. EM7): A day is considered extremely hot when the
maximum temperature on any given day exceeds the normal by at least 40C during March to May. A few
districts in Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya
Pradesh and North-Eastern states are likely to experience more frequent hot days compared to the base
line.
Change in incidence of extremely cold days (Fig. EM8): Defined as the number of days when the minimum
temperature is at least 40 C below normal during December to February, its occurrence is expected to
increase in whole of Gujarat, in a large number of districts in Rajasthan, and in some districts in Madhya
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and North-Eastern states. In
rest of the country, the number of days with cold wave conditions is expected to decrease.
Change in occurrence of frost (Fig. EM9): The number of days when the minimum temperature falls
below zero is projected to decrease by more than five days in a few districts in Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal
Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh. Frost occurrence is expected
to decrease by a maximum of five days in most parts of central and northern India.
Change in occurrence of drought (Fig. EM10): The incidence of drought, measured in terms of occurrence
of number of severe droughts per 100 years, increases in a few districts in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh,
Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, North-Eastern States, Karnataka, Tamilnadu,
Jammu & Kashmir and in a majority of districts in Kerala. Some districts in eastern Rajasthan, Punjab,
Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka are projected to experience drought less frequently.
Change in incidence of dry spells (Fig. EM11): Expressed as number of dry spells of 14 days at least, it
is expected to increase in some districts in eastern Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamilnadu,
Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Kerala.
99 percentile rainfall (Fig. EM12): Taken as an indicator triggering the incidence of floods, this is
expected to increase by more than five per cent in most districts in the country, except in a number of
districts in Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu and in a few districts in Karnataka, West Bengal and North-
Eastern states.
Change in number of events with more than 100 mm rainfall in three consecutive days (Fig. EM13):
This is another indicator related to extreme rainfall whose incidence is expected to increase in majority of
districts. It is projected to decline in some districts in Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Karnataka, West Bengal,
Rajasthan and North-Eastern states.
18
Change in mean maximum rainfall in a single event (Fig. EM14): The amount of rainfall received in a
single event is projected to increase in a few districts in states such as Gujarat, Madhya
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. In most
part of the country, it is expected to remain about the same as in the baseline and to decrease in a few
districts.
Change in mean maximum rainfall in three consecutive days (Fig. EM15): Compared to the baseline, a
much higher proportion of annual rainfall is projected to be received in a few districts in Gujarat,
Madhya Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and in north-eastern states. The intensity of such
extreme rainfall events is projected to decrease in most districts of Andhra Pradesh and in some districts
in the states such as Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Orissa and north-eastern
states.
Exposure Index (Fig. EM16): High to very high exposure is observed in districts of Madhya Pradesh,
Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Bihar, Tamilnadu, North-Eastern states and in Jammu &
Kashmir. Districts with low and very low exposure are seen in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal, parts
of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
5.2.2. Exposure (End-century relative to baseline)
Change in annual rainfall (Fig. EE1): Rainfall is projected to increase by more than five per cent in a
majority of districts except in a few districts in Rajasthan and Tamilnadu where it is projected to decrease
by more than five per cent. In a few districts in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamilnadu and
Arunachal Pradesh, the change in rainfall is expected to between -5 to +5 per cent compared to the
baseline period.
Change in rainfall during June (Fig. EE2): This is projected to decrease in majority of districts in
Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, much of Tamilnadu, Southern
parts of Chhattisgarh and Orissa, parts of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu Kashmir. In northern
and north-eastern states and in a few districts in Kerala, it is expected to increase by more than five per
cent.
Change in rainfall during July (Fig. EE3): Rainfall during July is projected to increase in most parts of
central and northern India and is expected to decrease by more than five per cent in many districts in
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan and in a few districts in Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir,
Maharashtra and Tamilnadu.
Change in number of rainy days (Fig. EE4): The rainfall is expected to be received in fewer days in
some districts of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamilnadu and north-eastern states. The number
of rainy days is expected to increase in a majority of districts in southern India and to remain about the
same in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and North-eastern
states.
Change in maximum temperature (Fig. EE5): Northern India is likely to experience much hotter days with
a rise in maximum temperature of 40C. Even in southern and central India, the maximum temperature is
expeted to increase by more than 30C except in a few districts on the west coast.
19
Change in minimum temperature (Fig. EE6): Except for the districts in Kerala and a few districts in Tamilnadu,
Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and in North-eastern states, the minimum temperature is expected to
rise at least by 40C in most part of the country. Some districts in hill states of Jammu & Kashmir Himachal
Pradesh, Uttarakhand as well as some in Rajasthan and Sikkim are likely to experience much warmer nights
as the minimum temperature is projected to rise by 5 to 5.50C.
Change in incidence of extremely hot days (Fig. EE7): The number of days when the maximum
temperature exceeds the normal temperature for the day by at least 40C is projected to increase in a
majority of districts in eastern, southern and northern states and decrease in Gujarat and in a number of
districts in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Jammu & Kashmir.
Change in incidence of extremely cold days (Fig. EE8): The frequency of occurrence of cold days, when
the minimum temperature falls below the normal temperature by at least 40C is projected to increase in a
majority of districts in central and western parts of the country, in the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat,
Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Karnataka. The frequency of occurrence of such colder nights is
expected to decrease in most parts of northern and north-east India and Tamilnadu.
Change in occurrence of frost (Fig. EE9): The number of days when the minimum temperature falls
below zero is projected to increase marginally in a few districts in Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh,
Uttarakhand and Sikkim. Frost occurrence is expected to decrease in most parts of central and northern
India, with the decrease being more conspicuous in districts of Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Jammu &
Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh.
Change in occurrence of drought (Fig. EE10): The incidence of drought, measured in terms of occurrence
of number of severe droughts per 100 years, is projected to increase by more than one in many districts
in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and in a few
districts in Bihar and North-Eastern States. Some districts in eastern Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra
Pradesh, Orissa, Tamilnadu, West Bengal and North Eastern states are projected to experience drought
less frequently.
Change in incidence of dry spells (Fig. EE11): Expressed as number of dry spells of 14 days at least, it
is expected to increase in some districts in eastern Madhya Pradesh, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh,
Jharkhand , Bihar, Orissa, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamilnadu. Dry spells are projected to be less
frequent in many districts of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, districts along the west coast,
Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and north-eastern states.
99 percentile rainfall (Fig. EE12): Taken as an indicator triggering the incidence of floods, this is
expected to increase by more than five per cent in most districts in the country, except in a number of
districts in Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu and in a few districts in Karnataka, Rajasthan and North-
Eastern states.
Change in number of events with more than 100 mm rainfall in three consecutive days (Fig. EE13):
This is another indicator related to extreme rainfall whose incidence is expected to increase in majority of
districts. It is projected to decline in some districts in Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Karnataka, Rajasthan,
Uttar Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh.
20
Change in mean maximum rainfall in a single event (Fig. EE14): The amount of rainfall received in a
single event is projected to increase in a few districts in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Jammu
& Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. In most parts of the country, it is expected
to remain about the same as in the baseline.
Change in mean maximum rainfall in three consecutive days (Fig. EE15): Compared to the baseline, a
much higher proportion of annual rainfall is projected to be received in a few districts in Rajasthan, Gujarat,
Punjab and Maharashtra. The intensity of such extreme rainfall events is projected to decrease in most
districts of Andhra Pradesh and in some districts in the states such as Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Maharashtra,
Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa and north-eastern states.
Exposure Index (Fig. EE16): High to very high exposure to climate change is observed in districts of
Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttrakhand, Chhattisgarh,
Karnataka, Maharashtra and north-eastern states. Districts with low and very low exposure are seen
along the west and east coasts of the country as well as in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, western Uttar
Pradesh, southern Madhya Pradesh, northern Maharashtra, Jharkhand and north-eastern states.
5.3 Adaptive Capacity indicators
Rural poverty (Fig. A1): Incidence of rural poverty is relatively higher (>40%) in some districts in Bihar,
Orissa, Jharkhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra. Poverty is relatively low in Punjab, Haryana,
Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala.
SC/ST Population (Fig. A2): More than 80 per cent of population belongs to SC/ST in a few districts in
Jammu & Kashmir, North-Eastern states and in Chhattisgarh. In most of the districts, it varies between 20
to 40 per cent.
Agricultural workers (Fig. A3): A higher proportion of main workers dependent on agriculture indicates a
higher importance of agriculture and inadequate access to livelihoods in non-agricultural sector and hence
a higher value means lower adaptive capacity. In a majority of districts, the dependency on agriculture is
more than 60 per cent. The proportion of main workers engaged in agriculture is less than 20 per cent in
a few districts in Kerala, Gujarat and Karnataka.
Literacy (Fig. A4): Sixty to eighty per cent of population is literate in a majority of districts in the country.
Whereas as the literacy rate exceeds 80 per cent in the districts along the west coast and in a few districts
in J &K, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Tamilnadu, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and
North-Eastern states, less than 60 per cent of population is literate in some pockets throughout the
country.
Gender gap (Fig. A5): Expressed as the difference between the general literacy rate and female literacy
rate, this is an indicator of gender equity. Districts with lower gap are better placed with respect to adaptive
capacity. The gender gap is found to be more conspicuous (15-20%) in a few districts in Rajasthan and
Jammu & Kashmir and is found to vary between 10 to 15 per cent in a majority of districts in central and
northern parts of the country.
21
Access to agricultural markets (Fig. A6): A well developed market infrastructure is a source of development
as they can help farmers get better prices and better access to inputs. In most of the districts, there are
less than five markets per lakh holdings.
Road connectivity (Fig. A7): A better transport infrastructure enables an improved integration of the
rural economy with the rest of the economy and thus helps diversify livelihoods. There are a few districts
in Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Orissa and North-Eastern states where less than 25 per
cent of villages are connected with roads. In many of districts in these states as well as in Uttar Pradesh,
Karnataka, Jammu & Kashmir and North-Eastern states, less than 75 per cent of villages are approachable
by paved roads.
Rural Electrification (Fig. A8): All the villages in many states are electrified. However, electrification of
villages is incomplete in districts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and in a few
districts in Rajasthan, Orissa and Chhattisgarh. Lack of electric supply is an indicator of underdevelopment
and hence of relatively less adaptive capacity.
Per cent Irrigated area (Fig. A9): Access to irrigation is an important source of adaptation to climate
variability and change. Less than 30 per cent of net sown area is irrigated in a majority of districts.
Districts in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and a majority of districts on the eastern coast have
more than 60 per cent of sown area under irrigation.
Density of livestock population (Fig. A10): Livestock rearing provides an important avenue for
diversification of income and hence is positively related to adaptive capacity. In a majority districts, the
livestock density is less than 200 adult cattle units/km2. Relatively higher densities (>300ACU/km2) are
observed in a few districts in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Tamilnadu.
Consumption of Fertilizer nutrients (Fig. A11): It is taken as a proxy to adoption of improved technologies
and hence districts with higher rates of nutrient consumption are better placed with respect to adaptive
capacity. Nutrient consumption exceeded 200 kg/ha in a considerable number of districts in Andhra
Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Tamilnadu and in a few districts in Karnataka, Maharashtra,
Gujarat, West Bengal and Jharkhand. It is low (<100 kg/ha) in a majority of districts in Rajasthan, Madhya
Pradesh, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and in North-Eastern states.
Groundwater availability (Fig.  A12): Higher availability of groundwater can enable adaptation to climate
change and variability. Less than 20 ha m of ground water is available per square kilometre of land in a
majority of districts in the country except in the states of Indo-Gangetic plains and in a number of districts
in North-Eastern states.
Contribution of agriculture to district domestic product (Fig. A13): Higher share of agriculture in the
total district domestic product indicates that other sectors are relatively underdeveloped and hence low
adaptive capacity. There are very few districts where agriculture contributes to more than 45 per cent of
DDP and these are located in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jammu & Kashmir and North-Eastern states.
Less than 15 per cent of domestic product comes from agriculture in a number of districts in Tamilnadu,
Maharashtra, Kerala and in a few districts in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand,
Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal etc.
22
Adaptive capacity Index (Fig. A14): Adaptive capacity is found to be very low in the eastern and north-
eastern states, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, peninsular and hill regions. Adaptive capacity is high in Punjab,
Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh, many districts along the east coast and in Tamilnadu.
5.4. Vulnerability index
Vulnerability Index (Fig. V1): Many districts in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and some
districts in Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttrakhand and Jharkhand exhibit high and very high
vulnerability. Most districts along the eastern and western coast, north-eastern states are less vulnerable.
Vulnerability Index (mid-century) (Fig. V2): Districts in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka,
Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu, eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar exhibit very high and high
vulnerability. Districts along the west coast, northern Andhra Pradesh, North-Eastern states are relatively
less vulnerable.
Vulnerability Index (end-century) (Fig. V3): Almost all districts in Rajasthan and many districts in Gujarat,
Maharashtra, Karnataka and a few districts most all in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab,
Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Andhra Pradesh exhibit very high vulnerability. A majority
of districts with low and very low vulnerability are located along the west coast, southern and eastern
parts of the country.
5.5. Other Indicators
Change in Rainfall per rainy day (mid-century) (Fig. O1): Defined as the total rainfall received to during
the year divided by the total number of rainy days during the year, the rainfall per rainy day is projected to
increase during the mid-century period compared to the baseline in a majority of districts in Maharashtra,
Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Nagaland, Manipur, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat and in a few
districts in Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttrakhand, Kerala and Karnataka. In a majority of northern and
western districts, it is projected to increase by less than  1 mm and whereas in distri cts of Andhra Pradesh,
Tamilnadu, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh it is projected to decrease.
Change in Rainfall per rainy day (end-century) (Fig. O2): Rainfall intensity in terms of rainfall per rainy
day is projected to increase in a majority of districts except in southern India and a few districts in Rajasthan,
Maharashtra, Arunachal Pradesh, Orissa and Jammu and Kashmir. It is expected to decrease by more
than 1mm per day in a few districts in northern Andhra Pradesh.
NDVI (AVHRR) (Fig. O3): There is a clear north - south axis to spatial distribution of agricultural vulnerability,
represent as variability in NDVI in the country. High variability in NDVI is observed in arid, semi-arid and
dry-sub-humid regions in the country. Map revealed that over 210 M ha in the country may be marginally
affected by climate change due to rainfall variability while 76.56 M ha would be moderately and 2.85 M
ha severely affected. These regions are essentially located in arid and semi-arid tracts in Rajasthan and
Gujarat. Thus, while livestock in western Rajasthan may be critically vulnerable, prosperous farmers from
cotton and groundnut growing belt in Gujarat may also face severe economic hardships and losses due to
climate change in future.
23
Geo-statistical analysis indicated that instead of 210 M ha as estimated using AVHRR 8-km NDVI data,
over 239.14 M ha may be marginally affected by climate change - induced vulnerability. Over 55 M ha may
be moderately vulnerable while over 8 M ha may be severely affected. Relatively higher coefficient of
variation in max NDVI is observed in districts of Rajasthan and Gujarat.
MODIS-NDVI (Fig. O4): The climate variability as indicated by the variation in the maximum NDVI (MODIS)
is relatively more in the western parts and along the Deccan plateau of the country. Most of the regions in
the eastern and northern parts and along the west coast have low variation indicating a more stable
climate/ rainfall. The districts exhibiting relatively higher variation in the NDVI are located in arid and
semi-arid regions, which include a transition belt between semi-arid and dry sub-humid zones. Districts
with high variability in maximum NDVI are located in Rajasthan and Gujarat (Table 5).

Table 6 gives the distribution of districts with varying degree of vulnerability. It can be seen that most of
the districts with very high and high vulnerability are in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh,
Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Similarly, of the 115 districts that are highly vulnerable to
climate change and variability, 18 are in Uttar Pradesh, 16 in Madhya Pradesh, 15 in Bihar, 9 in Haryana,
7 in Chhattisgarh and 6 each in Jharkhand, Gujarat and Rajasthan. Investments that enhance adaptive
capacity and resilience may be targeted in these districts.
Table 7 lists the most important three factors that are responsible for vulnerability in case of more
vulnerable districts, those with ‘very high’ and ‘high’ vulnerability. These three factors are identified by
selecting one variable that is contributing most to the vulnerability from each of the three components.
Thus, in case of variables that determine exposure of the district to climate change and variability, increase
in the drought incidence, increase in minimum temperature, decrease in rainfall during June and July
emerged as important factors suggesting the possible technological and other interventions needed. For
example, changes in rainfall pattern are better tackled by a combination of measures such as altering the
sowing dates, altering the crop duration to maturity and by enabling supplemental irrigation wherever
possible. In districts where likely increase in the incidence of extreme rainfall events is an important
source of vulnerability, interventions that protect the human and physical resources, a more coordinated
settlement planning are needed. This increased frequency may also be, wherever possible, seen as an
opportunity to harvest and store water for later use. Low rainfall, high drought incidence, low available
water holding capacity of soils, high flood proneness, larger area under agriculture are the most important
sensitivity-related factors contributing to vulnerability suggesting that the current approaches and
interventions related to rain water harvesting, watershed development, breeding for drought tolerant crop
varieties should continue to receive priority. The information provided is also helpful in prioritizing the
investments. For example in case of drought management, it may be useful to invest more in watershed
development in the districts where drought incidence is currently high and is also projected to increase in
future. The agencies concerned with watershed development like DoLR, NABARD, NRAA, State Level Nodal
Agencies (SLNA) may find this information quite useful for taking up watershed projects. Similarly,
investments and interventions may be planned in the districts with a larger area prone to incidence of
floods and where extreme rainfall events are likely to increase. The possible interventions include
modernizing drainage systems, strengthening embankments and promote submergence tolerant crop
varieties. A combination of measures such as advancing sowing dates, breeding of varieties with shorter
duration, diversification of cropping pattern may be needed where the temperatures are projected to
increase with possible adverse effects on crop yields.
In some districts, a very high proportion of land is under crop production pointing to the pressure on land.
With very little scope for expansion of cultivation, changing climate and its manifestations can hit livelihoods
harder by causing production and productivity losses. In these cases, there is a need to explore the
possibility of enhancing non-farm employment opportunities. In case of adaptive capacity, lack of or
inadequate irrigation facilities and low groundwater availability are important factors determining
vulnerability. The importance of irrigation in agricultural development can hardly be over emphasized.
89
What is more important is that making irrigation sustainable and more equitable. The changing rainfall
pattern, spatial and temporal, is to be appropriately and adequately factored in planning for expansion of
irrigation facilities. It is also needed to give more emphasis on supplemental and critical irrigation using
rain water harvesting. The planning for irrigation should also consider developing appropriate crop plans/
cropping pattern that optimize returns to farmers as well as maximize returns to water use. The connotation
of water use efficiency is to be taken in its broader meaning. Strengthening adaptive capacity is also
helpful for farmers in dealing with other development problems as well. In any case, consideration of
information related to all the indicators used in the construction of vulnerability index will be helpful in
identifying interventions that are more specific to the district. It may be added that considering any
intervention that is not relevant to and useful in dealing with the current problems of agriculture are less
likely to be accepted by farming community, it is preferable to identify the interventions that help farmers
deal with future climatic stress as well as with current climatic variability.
A look at different indicators related to climatic projections also showed some districts where the annual
rainfall is likely to increase and the number of rainy days to increase which actually present some
opportunities for harvesting more rain water which can be helpful in improving crop production and
productivity. There is a need to redesign rain water harvesting structures and strategies to handle higher
runoff in a shorter period so that surplus water is harvested while preventing soil loss too. There are also
some districts where the incidence of drought is projected to decline. Plans and strategies are therefore
to be put in place to optimize crop yields and incomes from such improved situation. Such opportunities
can be gainfully harnessed which in fact will be a significant step towards making Indian agriculture more
climate resilient and smart.
In summary, well thought-out strategic planning and coordinated implementation are needed to tackle
impacts of changing climate on Indian agriculture. Such planning is to be backed by sound scientific
understanding for targeting and prioritizing investments for technology development, infrastructure creation
and capacity building.

End notes
1. The approach to methodology for assessing vulnerability were finalized in a brainstorming workshop
conducted for the purpose.
2. We have included SC/ST population in adaptive capacity because of the consideration that the lack of
facilities for health, education, alternative employment opportunities are the factors that are responsible
for their poor adaptive capacity and these can be addressed through various policies.
3. Consideration by a group of experts of a broader list of indicators obtained through review of literature
and causal relationship with vulnerability led to this final set of indicators included in the analysis.
4. Though there are more recent outputs of improved climate projections from CMIP 5 (Chaturvedi et al.,
2012), the availability of data at the scale required is highly limited so far. As and when these recent
data sets are available, one can use those data sets. Also see the section on ‘Scope and Limitations’.
5. The authors are grateful to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA),
Government of United Kingdom, for sponsoring the joint Indo–UK programme on Climate Change and
the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), Government of India, for coordinating its
implementation. The thanks are due to the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, UK
Meteorological Office, for making available regional model -PRECIS. Support of the PRECIS simulation
datasets is provided by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.
6. We have included the number of markets from which the informaion is collected and disseminated by
AGMARKNET as a proxy for the number of all agricultural markets in the districts as the information on
the latter is not available.
7. From 2010 onwards, HDI is being computed as a geometric mean of the component indices. Before
2010, it was calculated as a simple average of the component indices.
8. The approach and the findings were discussed in a consultation meeting of stakeholders represented
by relevant government organizations such as Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Earth Sciences,
Ministry of Water Resources, National Rainfed Area Authority, India Meteorological Department, subject
matter experts from organizations such as Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Indian Institute of
Science, The Energy and Resources Institute, MS Swaminathan Research Foundation, National Remote
Sensing Centre, ICRISAT, NIRD and development and donor agencies such as DFID, GIZ, AFPRO.
