The work that resulted in this document was triggered by, among other things, one of the 
recommendations of a third party evaluation of NICRA. A document on district level assessment of 
vulnerability to climate change was first published in 2013 under this project which was well received 
and was found useful by many stakeholders. Considering the utility of such an analysis and other 
developments in conceptualization of vulnerability, availability of more advanced climate projections 
based on IPCC’s AR 5 and the very nature of vulnerability to be dynamic, this study is an attempt to 
take forward and revise the earlier analysis in the light of these developments. This study received 
support, encouragement and guidance from Dr T. Mohapatra, Director General, ICAR & Secretary, 
DARE. The progress was also reviewed in HLMC meeting chaired by DG, ICAR. We express our 
sincere gratitude to DG, ICAR & Secretary, DARE.
We are immensely thankful to Dr K. Alagudundaram, Deputy Director General (NRM and Agricultural 
Engineering), ICAR for his support and guidance throughout this study and for his key role in

Climate change has emerged as a challenge to livelihoods and wellbeing of the people world over (Sani and 
Chalchisa, 2016). According to the Assessment Report (AR) 5 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC), the global surface temperature is likely to increase by 1.50C by 2100 relative to the period 1850-
1900 (IPCC, 2013). The frequency of extreme events is also projected to increase in future. The projections 
with respect to precipitation are, however, more uncertain. The national governments as well as international 
agencies concerned with climate change have now recognized that adaptation is as important as mitigation 
as the benefits of latter will take decades to be realized. In the context of developing countries adaptation is 
even more important. Intensified adaptation efforts are needed in spite of the Paris Agreement arrived at CoP 
21 to limit warming to 1.50C (Runhaar et al., 2018). Adaptation requires resources in terms of investments 
and interventions. However, considering climate and climate change are spatially variable, not all regions are 
equally impacted by climate change and vary with their capacities to adapt and shocks to adapt to. Globally, 
temperatures are projected to rise at higher latitudes but no region is expected to witness fall in temperature. 
Trends in rainfall are more variable spatially.
India is one of the countries that are more vulnerable to climate change (Cruz et al., 2007). The Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) 5 projections for India show that the average climate is likely to be warmer 
by 1.7 to 2.00C for 2030s and by 3.3 – 4.80C for 2080s compared to the pre-industrial times (Chaturvedi 
et al., 2012). The precipitation is likely to increase by 5 to 6 per cent and 6 to 14 per cent, for 2030s and 
2080s, respectively. Agriculture, being a biological production process, is obviously affected by climate and 
hence the projected change in climate will have implications to sustainability of agricultural production and of 
livelihoods of those dependent on agriculture. As climate change aggravates all other problems such as land 
degradation, market volatility, rising input costs, slowing response to added inputs that hinder agricultural 
growth, it is recognized as a potent threat to sustainability of agriculture. Developing countries such as India, 
with their relatively higher dependence on agriculture for livelihoods, are more likely to suffer from such an 
impending climate change.
There is emerging evidence that the productivity of crops, livestock and fish is likely to be affected with 
implications to food security, livelihoods and sustainability in agriculture. Both the changes in mean climate and 
the variability therein will affect growth and productivity of crops and livestock. It can be broadly generalized 
that rising temperature and declining rainfall will adversely affect agricultural productivity, though there can 
be certain exceptions such as rising temperature in the temperate hill regions may help improve productivity of 
crops. In India, several studies have projected declining crop yields, in the absence of adaptation, in response 
to changing climate characterized by rising temperature. The impacts of rising temperature on crop yields are 
stronger than positive impacts of the rising atmospheric CO2 levels (Jayaraman, 2011), the latter being referred 
to as carbon fertilization effect. The negative effects of temperature on farm revenue outweigh the smaller 
positive effects of increasing precipitation (Kumar and Parikh, 2001).
Adaptation is a necessary response to deal with climate change in agriculture and in other sectors such as 
infrastructure, urban planning, public health (Wamsler, 2015). The adaptation response can be effective 
through either mainstreaming or integrating into the existing development programmes or through developing 
dedicated climate change focussed programmes. Both ways need information on what to adapt to and how 
to adapt. More specifically, information on what future climate is going to look like in terms of changes in 
temperature, rainfall patterns, etc. as well as the conditions or features of the system of interest that predispose 
to the climate change impacts. Such an analysis, which can be a useful initial step in adaptation planning, is 
referred to as vulnerability analysis. 
1 Background
2
In order to develop technologies and strategies for enhancing resilience of Indian agriculture to climate 
change, the Indian Council of Agriculture (ICAR), Ministry of Agriculture & and Farmers’ Welfare (MoAFW), 
Government of India (GoI) initiated the project ‘National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture’ (NICRA) 
during 2011, the second phase of which, commencing from 2017, is called ‘National Innovations in Climate 
Resilient Agriculture (NICRA). A district level analysis of vulnerability of agriculture to climate change (Rama 
Rao et al., 2013, 2016) is an important output of the initial phase of NICRA, which is being used by many 
different stakeholders in planning and locating various adaptation efforts.
1.1. Need for revising the vulnerability analysis
Vulnerability is essentially a dynamic concept, ex ante in nature (Ionescu et al., 2008) and responds to 
development efforts. It is a concept with origins in social sciences. However, the word vulnerability is used to 
denote different things by researchers in many different domains of research such as development economics, 
disaster management, geography, etc. However, the concept and definitions of vulnerability as given by 
the IPCC are most frequently adopted in the context of climate change. Following this, the vulnerability 
assessment done in NICRA during 2013 (Rama Rao e al., 2013, 2016) adopted the definition and framework 
of vulnerability analysis given by the IPCC in its 3rd and 4th Assessment Reports. Vulnerability, as per IPCC 
(2001, 2007) was viewed as residual impact, as conceptualized in Fussel and Klein (2006), on a system of 
interest due to exposure after accounting for adaptation. Thus, vulnerability is seen as residual impact and 
framed as a resultant of sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity. The first two dimensions of vulnerability 
determine the potential impact which will be moderated by adaptation, a manifestation of adaptive capacity. In 
this framework, ‘sensitivity’ is referred to as the ability or propensity of the system to be adversely or positively 
affected by an external shock such as climate change which is referred to as ‘exposure’. Adaptive capacity, 
which is a precursor to adaptation, refers to the ability of the system to respond to climate change to avoid or 
minimize the impact and is a function of factors such as wealth, technology, education, skills, infrastructure, 
access to resources, etc (McCarthy, et al., 2001). Such a framework warrants inclusion of a range of non-climatic 
socio-economic information in the vulnerability analysis. Most of such socioeconomic variables change over 
time in response to the development efforts of government in various sectors. Also, the ‘exposure’ dimension 
of vulnerability entails capturing future climate projections based on different global and/or regional climate 
models. Such climate models also evolve over time with the advances made in understanding the physical basis 
of global and regional climate and in the ability to model such understanding. Thus, the relative vulnerability 
of districts, which is the unit of analysis in the analysis, was assessed through a number of indicators selected 
to capture the three dimensions of vulnerability. In particular, the sensitivity and adaptive capacity were 
captured through agro-climatic and socio-economic indicators. On the other hand, the exposure was captured 
by considering the climate projections obtained through the regional climate model, PRECIS, which was found 
more appropriate to be used in Indian conditions (MoEF, 2012). However, most of the indicators used in the 
analysis would have changed over time that can potentially alter the relative vulnerability of districts to climate 
change. Further, the IPCC in its 5th Assessment Report adopted a different conceptualization of vulnerability 
incorporating many elements of vulnerability that have evolved over time and to make such an analysis more 
policy relevant. This report was also accompanied by climate projections from more advanced global climate 
models of CMIP-5 that report projections based on what are called Representative Concentration Pathways 
(RCP) that take into consideration the mitigation actions. 
Further, the progress in NICRA was evaluated by an independent agency as part of the monitoring mechanism 
of the project. The evaluation, among other things, while appreciating the appropriateness and utility of the 
district level vulnerability analysis as one of the important outcomes of the project, also recommended to revisit 
the analysis, perhaps, because of the reasons mentioned above. Therefore, we attempted to revise the analysis 
by adopting the conceptualization and framework of vulnerability as given in the AR 5 of the IPCC and by 
using the more recent data on agro-climatic and socio-economic indicators. As far as climate projections that 
are essential to be included in the analysis, we used a sub-set of CMIP-5 global climate models to capture the 
future climate. 
3
The literature on vulnerability and its assessment is continually evolving drawing on works in different 
fields. The dynamic trait of vulnerability and its components is not adequately addressed in the Third and 
Fourth Assessment Reports of the IPCC. The recent literature suggests that the risks due to climate change 
are also a result of complex interactions among social and ecological systems and the hazards arising out of 
climate change rather than being externally generated alone. Various facets of these interactions have to be 
carefully differentiated to understand risk to inform policy making for risk management. The AR 5 framework 
emphasizes these aspects as well as that the very components of vulnerability and risk will also interact with 
the contextual factors of development pathways and the climate systems (Oppenheimer et al., 2014). Also, 
inclusion of ‘exposure’ as a component of vulnerability as in AR 4 framework, may trigger decisions that may 
potentially lead to maladaptation given the uncertainty associated with climate projections. 
2.1. Vulnerability – a component of risk assessment 
The AR5 proposes a different framework where in vulnerability is placed as one of the determinants of 
risk, the other two being ‘exposure’ and ‘hazard’. The definitions given in AR 5 for risk and its components 
(Oppenheimer, et al., 2014) are given below:
Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental functions, services, and 
resources, infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely 
affected.
Vulnerability: The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety 
of concepts and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.
Impacts: The term impacts is used primarily to refer to the effects on natural and human systems of extreme 
weather and climate events and of climate change. Impacts generally refer to effects on lives, livelihoods, 
health, ecosystems, economies, societies, cultures, services, and infrastructure due to the interaction of climate 
changes or hazardous climate events occurring within a specific time period and the vulnerability of an exposed 
society or system. Impacts are also referred to as consequences and outcomes. The impacts of climate change 
on geophysical systems, including floods, droughts, and sea level rise, are a subset of impacts called physical 
impacts. 
Hazard: The potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend or physical impact 
that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, 
livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems, and environmental resources. In this report, the term hazard usually 
refers to climate-related physical events or trends or their physical impacts.
Risk: The potential for consequences where something of value is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain, 
recognizing the diversity of values. Risk is often represented as probability of occurrence of hazardous events 
or trends multiplied by the impacts if these events or trends occur.
Risk = (Probability of Events or Trends) × Consequences
Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard.

Conceptual shift from AR 4 to AR 5:
Vulnerability as a Determinant of Risk
4
The AR4 and AR5 definitions and frameworks view the terms ‘vulnerability’ and ‘exposure’ differently. 
Exposure in the AR 4 terminology is related to climate related shocks that a system is exposed to whereas 
the AR 5 describes it being related to the individuals, systems, etc. being exposed to the ‘hazard’, a concept 
introduced in AR 5 framework. Vulnerability, as per AR 5, is more a predisposition to an external shock and 
whether it will lead to risk depends on whether the vulnerable system is located (exposure) in a place where 
the ‘hazards’ are likely to occur. A highly vulnerable system may not suffer risk due to climate change or a 
less vulnerable system may face risk if it is placed where severe hazard incidence is possible. In terms of 
AR 4 terminology, vulnerability as viewed in AR 5 is independent of ‘exposure’ (Sharma and Ravindranath, 
2019; Sharma et al., 2018). Thus, the relationship between these three components of risk are more explicit 
and policy relevant. The AR 5 vulnerability framework is closer to the disaster management conceptualization 
which is considered more appropriate in the context of climate change.
Fig 1. IPCC’s AR 5 framework of risk assessment 
(Adapted from Oppenheimer et al., 2014)
The AR 5 risk conceptualization furthers the risk analysis by identifying two kinds of risk: key risks and 
emergent risks. Key risks are potentially severe consequences arising when systems with high vulnerability 
interact with severe hazards. Different criteria are suggested to categorize a risk as key which are based on 
the magnitude of the risk, high vulnerability of a particular group of population, criticality of the sector in the 
economy. Emergent risks are those that are not direct consequences of climate change hazard but are results of 
responses to climate change. For example, migration of population from a region due to climate change related 
hazards may increase the vulnerability and thus risk of receiving regions; similarly increased groundwater 
extraction during a drought may increase the vulnerability and risk in future. Thus, emergent risks are a result 
of spatial linkages and temporal dynamics related to responses to changing climate. Thus AR 5 framework 
places more emphasis on identifying and managing risk and thus views vulnerability as a determinant. Such 
conceptualization and framework will be more relevant to policy making.

The difference in conceptual framing of vulnerability as given in the AR 4 and AR 5 of IPCC is summarized 
in figure 2.

3.1. Approaches and types of vulnerability assessment
Vulnerability is postulated differently depending on the context of analysis. ‘Outcome vulnerability is 
conceptualized as ‘end point’ analysis where in the impact of climate change is examined on productivity 
or production of a particular crop or animal species either through simulation modelling or through physical 
experimentation. This is also referred to as biophysical impact assessment or first generation vulnerability 
assessment. Such assessments “superimpose future climate scenarios on an otherwise constant world to 
estimate the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on a climate-sensitive system” (Fussel and 
Klein, 2006). As the purpose of such assessment was to identify strategies that reduce vulnerability of the 
systems or populations concerned, vulnerability assessments became more policy oriented. 
The socio-economic approach to vulnerability assessment proposes that the attributes of the system or entity 
of interest predispose it to the adverse impacts of an external shock (climate change or variability) (Adger and 
Kelly, 1999) and thus it is referred to as ‘starting point analysis’. In this case, vulnerability is regarded as a pre-
existing condition (Jurgilevech et al., 2017) in terms of health, education, wealth, etc. of the individuals and 
the differential endowments of individuals are responsible for varying vulnerability. 
The integrated approach combines both these approaches integrating bio-physical and socio-economic 
dimensions of vulnerability. As the vulnerability assessments evolved, more non-climatic data became a part 
of such assessments.
Current vulnerability analyses the current risks to the system of interest whereas future vulnerability assessments 
are concerned with future risks. Vulnerability assessment is considered static or dynamic whether the temporal 
changes in the predisposing conditions and/or risk are considered in the analysis. 
The present analysis can be referred as the current vulnerability to future climate change as the objective is 
to inform the decision making process ‘currently’ to help minimize future climate change risk. Vulnerability 
is important in managing risk arising out of climate change because the other two determinants, hazard and 
exposure, are relatively more difficult to change in ways that reduce risk. For example, altering exposure 
requires shifting people or systems from the locations where they are currently existing. Similarly, preparing 
for and adapting to projected climate change hazard has to deal with the uncertainties associated with climate 
projections, especially considering the fact that adaptation is essentially local in nature. On the other hand, 
strengthening or altering those features underlying the susceptibility of the system to climate change hazard, is 
relatively better and pragmatic approach to vulnerability reduction or risk reduction. 
There are different approaches and methods to assessment of vulnerability and risk analysis ranging from 
indicator-based methods to more participatory local level assessments (Cardona et al., 2012). However, 
the choice of method is determined by the purpose of analysis, availability of data and resources including 
human resources. ‘Indicator method’ is one of the frequently used methods because of its transparency and 
attractiveness to policy makers. The method is particularly useful when the purpose is to identify regions with 
different levels of vulnerability and risk so that investments and interventions can be better prioritized and 
targeted. Therefore, the indicator method was adopted.
3 Approach and Methodology

3.2. Selection of Indicators
Indicators are the variables that are closely associated with the phenomenon or concept that is intended to be 
quantified or measured, but difficult to be measured. In other words, the (relative) values of indicators, when 
viewed individually or in the form of an aggregate index, will help understand the relative position of the 
system or unit of interest vis-à-vis other units with respect to the phenomenon that the indicators are associated 
with. Thus, indicators or indicator method is more useful in planning development interventions and if tracked 
over time, can be a useful tool of monitoring and evaluation of any programme, as observed by Crane et al. 
(2017) in case of vulnerability. 
In this analysis, we chose indicators that reflect the three dimensions of risk, i.e., hazard, exposure and 
vulnerability by considering the definitions and meanings mentioned in section 2.1. The choice of indicators 
was guided by review of literature (e.g. Esteves et al., 2013, 2016; Ravindranath et al., 2011; O’Brien et al., 
2004, 2007; Rama Rao et al., 2013; Upgupta et al., 2015), theoretical considerations of what underlie different 
determinants of risk and stakeholder consultation. 
Hazard refers to the occurrence of climate shock in the context of climate change. In this analysis, hazard was 
represented in two forms: future climate hazard and historic hazard. The future climate hazard was captured 
in terms of agriculturally relevant indicators derived from the climate projections from a subset of CMIP-5 
global climate models1.
3.2.1. Multi-model ensemble of climate projections for RCP 4.5 at 0.50 X 0.50 grids for India
In this study, the IPCC’ Fifth Assessment Report’s climate change projections based on RCP’s were used. 
Bias corrected and spatially disaggregated (BCSD) projections from the World Climate Research Program’s 
(WRCP’s) CMIP 5 multi-model dataset were used to generate multi-model ensemble climate change scenarios. 
Climate change projections of 30 GCM from 21 modelling centres/ groups were used. As different GCMs have 
multiple runs, we used 61 projections (runs) for RCP 4.5, for generating climate change scenarios.
Though delta change method is the most commonly used method for generating future climate scenarios, 
it does not consider variability or change in time series behaviour in the future. Therefore, the hybrid-delta 
ensemble method that considers inter-annual variability for each month was used (Islam et al. 2012a, b; Tohver 
et al. 2014). This method uses quantile mapping approach (Wood et al. 2002) to re-map the observations 
onto the bias corrected GCM data (historical and future time series) to produce the historic and future GCM 
projected rainfall and temperature data corresponding to the non-exceedance probability of observed rainfall 
and temperature data. Using the hybrid-delta ensemble method, we generated multi-model ensemble climate 
change scenarios for four different RCPs and three future periods (2020s, 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s). However, 
in this analysis, results pertaining to RCP4.5 for the period of 2030s (2020-49) are only used. The names of 
GCMs used and the number of runs are presented in Annexure I. The climate projections for RCP 4.5 for the 
period 2020-49 are used to derive the indicators of future hazard2 (Table 1).

The IITM, Pune has recently provided the climate projections from the CORDEX project to be used for Indian conditions. 
However, they were not available when this exercise began.
2	
We constructed two sets of future hazard indicators using climate projections based on RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0 for the period 2040-
69. However, a recommendation emerged on presentation of draft results in a meeting of stakeholders held on 20 July 2018 that 
the climate projections for RCP 4.5 for the period 2020-49 be used.

Source of data: All these indicators are computed using the daily data on rainfall, maximum temperature and 
minimum temperature as obtained from a subset of CMIP-5 group of global climate models for RCP 4.5 for 
the period 2020-49. These data are downscaled to 0.50 X 0.50 grids. Using the data at grid level, the district 
level estimates are arrived at by taking weighted average with the areas of the Thiessen Polygons in a district.
Thus, indicators reflecting change in average climate and in extreme events in temperature and rainfall are 
derived from the projections and included. 
Hazard is also represented as the historical incidence of extreme events as presented in table 2.

As indicated earlier, vulnerability is considered as an internal trait of the system that predisposes the system to 
an external hazard. Any characteristic of the system that helps adapt to or deal with hazard better help reduce 
the adverse impacts or risk due to hazard. Vulnerability is a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity where 
the former denotes the system’s propensity to be affected and the latter the ability to adapt to the hazard. In this 
analysis, the indicators selected are categorized into different capital endowments which determine the ability 
of the system to deal with the hazard. Thus, fifteen indicators related to five different dimensions of capital 
endowment - natural, human, social, physical and financial - are selected to capture vulnerability (Table 4).

3.3. Computation of indices of risk and its determinants
In order to compute the indices of hazard, exposure and vulnerability and finally of risk, a database of all the 
indicators for the 573 rural districts of India (excluding the Union Territories of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, 
Lakshadweep) was created. The indicators were normalized to bring all the indicators to a common scale and 
to make them unit-free by computing Z-scores in case of indicators related to exposure, vulnerability and 
historical hazard. The Z-scores are computed as follows:
Zi = (Xi – µ) / s when the indicator is positively related to the respective index,
Zi = - (Xi – µ) / s when the indicator is inversely related to the respective index,
where Xi and Zi are actual and normalized values of the indicators for ith district, m and s are mean and standard 
deviation, respectively.
As mentioned earlier, the indicators related to future hazard are expressed in terms of changes from the baseline 
climate. Thus, any change in the indicator values will increase or decrease the degree of hazard depending on 
the indicator and zero change indicates that climate change is going to be neither better nor worse as far as the 
indicator in question is concerned. It would then be appropriate that the normalized value retains the sign of 
the actual value which the Z-score normalization does not allow. Even the ‘min-max’ normalization adopted 
in a number of studies including Rama Rao et al (2013, 2016) does not retain the sign of the actual indicator. 
Therefore, the following normalization formula was adopted in case of indicators related to future hazard:
when the indicator is positively related to the respective index: Zi = Xi / (XMax – XMin) when the indicator 
includes 0 in its range, or Zi = Xi / |X|Maxwhen the indicator has only positive or only negative values;
when the indicator is inversely related to the respective index: Zi = -Xi / (XMax – XMin) when the indicator 
includes 0 in its range, or Zi = - Xi / |X|Max when the indicator has only positive or only negative values.
where Xi, and Zi are actual value and normalized value of the indicator for ith district and XMax and XMin are 
maximum and minimum values of indicator, respectively.
In order to obtain the indices, the normalized indicators have to be aggregated. While computing such aggregate 
indices, it is possible that the extreme values of indicators will unduly affect the index. This issue was addressed 
by (i) the upper values were specified based on certain considerations such as crop response as in case of 
rainfall (1500 mm), (ii) 99 percentile in case of rural population density, net per capita income, livestock 
density, fertiliser use, (iii) log transformation of indicator values in case market density/access, (iv) use of 
exponential function to capture the impact of dry spells, and (v) the future hazard indicators were truncated at 
1 and 99 percentile values. Moderating extreme values of indicators not only allows better discrimination in 
rest of the data but also reduces the unduly large influence on the resulting aggregate index when combined 
with other indicators. 
After normalizing the indicators, they were aggregated into the indices of historical hazard, future hazard, 
exposure, vulnerability and finally of risk. Weights to indicators of each determinant of risk were obtained 
through expert consultation wherein 20 experts from different disciplines of agricultural research such as 
agronomy, soil and water conservation, soil science, agrometeorology, crop physiology, pest management, 
agricultural economics, agricultural statistics, agricultural extension, were involved. The whole process, right 
from the approach, methodology, indicator selection, weighting, etc., was presented and discussed in two 
consultation meetings with representatives from different stakeholder organizations comprising development 
departments of the government (e.g. DACFW, MoWR, NRAA, NIRDPR, MANAGE), other ministries or 
departments concerned with climate change (e.g. MoEFCC, IMD, IITM), national and international research 
organizations (e.g. NIAP, ICRISAT, IFPRI, IWMI), academic institutions (e.g. IISc, IEG, MSE), NGOs (e.g. 
WASSAN), and other agencies such as TERI in addition to representatives from the ICAR. Table 5 presents 
the weights of different indicators in each of the four determinants of risk.

It is to be mentioned here that the index values are relative in nature and can only be used to order the districts. 
A high index for risk results from higher values of any or some of the determinants. The index values in case 
of vulnerability, exposure and historical hazard are centred around mean which means that values nearer to 
average represent the ‘average situation’ and those away from the mean represent better or worse situation 
owing to the normalization method used. On the other hand, the index values for future hazard are centred 
around zero in the sense that values near zero mean climate change is ‘neutral’ and those away from zero 
mean a worsening or improving climate, and accordingly chose nomenclature for describing future hazard as 
above. Further, the distribution of districts into different categories changes with the number of categories or 
with the threshold values of each category, the choice of which is subjective. For example, if we were to make 
three or seven categories of risk, the number of districts will change in all the categories. The relative ranking 
(Annexure II) of districts with respect to risk or its determinants is more important for policy considerations.

The status of the districts in the country with respect to different indicators of hazard, exposure and vulnerability 
is presented in this section. The results of aggregation of the indicators into the indices of hazard, exposure 
and vulnerability and finally of risk are also presented. The relative ranking of all the districts based on all the 
indices is presented as Annexure II. As mentioned earlier, this relative ranking may as well be used by decision 
makers for prioritizing, targeting and allocation of resources.
4.1. Exposure Indicators
Net Sown Area: Net sown area, expressed in terms of per cent of geographical area under cultivation, showed 
variability across the country. The area under cultivation exceeded 80 per cent of geographical area in 40 
districts of which 24 are in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Sixty to eighty per cent of geographical area is cultivated 
in 151 districts predominantly located in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya 
Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. Relatively less area (< 20%) is cultivated in 92 districts majority of which are 
in the north-eastern states and in Himalayan states of Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand (Fig E1).
Rural population density: This indicates the pressure on land resources. Population density is more than 800/
km2 in 66 districts many of which are located in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Population pressure is relatively low 
(<200/ km2) in the north-eastern states and in the states such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh (Fig E2). 
Small and marginal farmers: Indian agriculture is dominated by small holdings. About 85 per cent of holdings 
in the country are less than 2 ha in size. Together, small and marginal farmers operate about 45 per cent of the 
net sown area in the country. The dominance of small holdings is conspicuous throughout the country with 358 
districts having more than 80 per cent of small and marginal farmers. The average farm size, which is inversely 
related to the proportion of small and marginal holdings, is relatively high in states of Rajasthan and Arunachal 
Pradesh where they constitute less than 20 per cent of total holdings (Fig E3). 
SC/ST population: The population belonging to scheduled castes and schedules tribes ranged between 20 and 
40 per cent in 277 out of 573 districts. They constituted more than 80 per cent in 40 districts many of which 
are located in north-eastern states (Fig E4). 
Cross-bred cattle: Cross-bred cattle, though more productive, are more susceptible to climate change and 
variability. The proportion of cross-bred cattle is high (>40%) in 73 districts. In a majority of districts, cross-
bred cattle accounted for less than 10 per cent of total large and small ruminant population (Fig E5).
4.2. Vulnerability indicators
Annual Rainfall: Annual rainfall is one of the important determinants of agricultural production. A wide 
variation exists with respect to rainfall in the country. The annual rainfall is less than 500 mm in 28 districts 
largely located in Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab. The rainfall ranged between 500 - 700 mm in 59 districts. 
One hundred and ninety five districts largely located in eastern and north-eastern states, Kerala and Maharashtra 
receive more than 1300 mm rainfall annually (Fig V1).
4  Findings
19
Area under degraded and waste land: Degraded lands are low in productivity as the physical, chemical, 
physiographical and biological conditions of soils are not favourable to health crop or vegetation growth. 
Abiotic stress conditions induced by climate change can make agricultural production even more difficult and 
risky. More than 60 per cent of geographical area under degraded and waste lands in 131 districts located in 
Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala and north-eastern states (Fig V2).
Available water holding capacity (AWC) of the soil: AWC indicates the amount of water that the plant 
can take from the soil and is a function of soil texture and depth. It is less than 60 mm in 164 districts many 
of which are located in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. About 154 
districts in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Haryana, soils can hold more than 125 mm of 
water (Fig V3).
Groundwater availability: Groundwater is the most dominant source of irrigation in the country and is one 
of the most yield stabilizing factor. Low groundwater availability is a potent constraint to stable agricultural 
production. Availability of groundwater is less than 20 ha m/ km2 in as many as 390 districts of the country. It 
exceeded 40 ha m/ km2 in 42 districts only most of which are in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Assam (Fig V4).
Livestock population: This is an indicator of adaptive capacity as livestock provides an alternative source 
of income during the periods of climatic shock such as drought. Higher livestock numbers are thus associated 
with better adaptive capacity. In 259 districts of the country, livestock density is less than 100 ACU/km2 of 
geographical area. The density is more than 300 ACU/km2 in 25 districts only (Fig V5).
Literacy: Adaptation to climate change requires ability to access information and knowledge from a variety 
of sources and as such an important determinant of adaptive capacity and vulnerability. Literacy levels in a 
majority of districts (372) in the country ranged between 60 to 80 per cent. However, 45 districts still have 
literacy levels between 40 to 60 per cent (Fig V6). 
Gender Gap: Measured as the difference between total literacy and female literacy, this is an indicator of gender 
equity. The need for higher female literacy also assumes importance given the current trends in feminization of 
agriculture partly as a result of migration of male earning members of the household. Relatively wide gender 
gap (15 - 20%) is noticed in 17 districts only. Many of them are in Rajasthan (Fig V7).
Self-help groups: Social capital is an important enabling mechanism to access information, financial capital 
and technology. Self-help groups are an important form of social capital in rural India. Measured as per cent 
of villages in the district having self-help groups, social capital is more than 80 per cent in 248 districts. Less 
than 40 per cent of villages have self-help groups in 133 districts (Fig V8). 
Net Irrigated Area: Irrigation is the single most important yield enhancing and stabilizing factor in agriculture. 
Less than 20 per cent of the net sown area is irrigated in 145 districts. Many of these districts are located in the 
states of Maharashtra, Odisha, Assam, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, etc. On the other hand, more than 80 per cent 
of net sown area has access to irrigation in 122 districts in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, 
Rajasthan, etc (Fig V9).
Road connectivity: A better transport infrastructure, of which road connectivity is a part, is critical to connect 
farmers to markets. Investments in infrastructure creation resulted in as many as 149 out 0f 573 districts having 
almost all (>95%) villages connected by paved roads. However, there is some work left in this regard in 105 
districts where less than half of villages are connected by paved roads (Fig V10).
Rural electrification: This is another aspect of infrastructure development which is associated with better 
adaptive capacity. Less than 20 per cent of households have electricity for lighting in 81 districts of the country. 
They are mostly in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha (Fig V11).
20
Market density: Access to markets and improved marketing facilities is important to translate higher 
productivity into better profits. The number of regulated markets in each district can be an indicator of 
marketing facilities. Expressed as number of markets per lakh farmers, market density varied from less than 2 
in 219 districts to more than 8 in 91 districts (Fig V12). 
Fertilizer Use: This indicator is taken as a proxy for technology adoption as well as input supply infrastructure 
for agriculture though it is strongly influenced by cropping pattern and irrigation. Thus, higher fertiliser use 
can be related to better adaptive capacity of farmers. Less than 100 kg of fertiliser nutrients were applied per 
ha of gross sown area in as many as 251 districts where as it exceeded 300 kg/ha in 46 districts. Districts with 
low fertilizer use are observed in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Assam, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, 
etc (Fig V13).
Per capita Income: This is an obvious indicator of adaptive capacity and is inversely related to vulnerability. 
High per capita income allows investments necessary to deal with climate change. Bihar and Uttar Pradesh 
host 55 of 57 districts with a per capita income of less than INR 15,000. It ranged between INR 15000 - 30000 
in 191 districts with Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Assam, Jharkhand, etc. (Fig V14).
Income inequity: This is measured as the difference between the per cent workforce dependent on agriculture 
and the per cent contribution to district domestic product. A higher value indicates more dependence on 
agriculture and hence is associated with higher vulnerability. The inequity ranged between 40 - 60 per cent 
in 286 districts of the country and is more than 60 per cent in 24 districts some of which are located in 
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, etc (Fig V15). 
4.3. Historical Hazard
Drought proneness: Drought is an important climate related hazard in India. The incidence of drought is more 
than 15 per cent in 48 districts of the country out of which 26 are located in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Since this 
indicator is expressed in terms of severe drought which is equivalent to two moderate droughts, it follows that 
the probability of occurrence of drought is 30 per cent in these 48 districts (Fig HH 1).
Flood proneness: Districts with larger areas subjected to flooding face high hazard. More than 60 per cent 
of area is prone to flood incidence in 39 districts and another 58 districts have flood prone area in the range 
of 30 – 60 per cent. Many of these flood prone districts are in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and West Bengal 
(Fig HH2).
Cyclone proneness: This indicator is computed considering five parameters viz., number of cyclones crossing 
the district, number severe cyclones crossing the district, probable rainfall for a day, probable maximum winds 
in know and probable maximum storm surge. High and very high cyclone proneness is observed in 46 districts 
largely located in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu (Fig HH3).
4.4. Future Hazard Indicators
As mentioned earlier, these are derived from the climate projections for the period 2020-49 for the RCP 4.5. 
The daily projections on rainfall, maximum temperature and minimum temperature for 2020-49 are converted 
into agriculturally relevant indicators and are expressed in terms of change with respect to baseline period 
1976-2005. The information on the status of these 15 indicators for the baseline period is presented in figures 
in Annexure III.
Change in annual rainfall: Projections indicate no considerable change in annual rainfall with 396 districts 
expected to receive 3 – 6 per cent more rainfall compared to 1976-2005 baseline. However, rainfall is expected 
to increase by more than 6 per cent in 57 districts of which 21 are in Gujarat, 8 in Madhya Pradesh, 5 in Uttar 
Pradesh, 4 in Rajasthan and 3 in Tamil Nadu (Fig FH1). 
21
Change in rainfall during June: Climate projections indicate a marginal decline in rainfall during June in 27 
districts. Nine of these 27 districts are in Karnataka, 7 in Maharashtra and 4 in Kerala. On the other hand, June 
rainfall in 45 districts is expected to increase by more than 6 per cent. In most districts (501), marginal increase 
in rainfall is expected (Fig FH2).
Change in rainfall during July: Rainfall during July is critical to the beginning of the agricultural season in 
the country. In most of the districts (471), July rainfall is projected to increase marginally by up to five per cent. 
It is expected to decline marginally in 12 districts (6 in Karnataka, 2 in Kerala) only (Fig FH3).
Change in number of rainy days: Number of rainy days is an indicator of temporal distribution of rainfall. 
Fewer rainy days are projected for 48 districts. Rainy days are expected to increase by more than three in 12 
districts of Gujarat, four districts of Rajasthan, two each in Maharashtra and Mizoram (Fig FH4).
Change in maximum temperature: Maximum temperature is expected to increase by 1 to 1.30C in 256 
districts, by 1.3 to 1.60C in 157 districts. Highest increase of more than 1.90C is projected for three districts in 
Himachal Pradesh, two in Jammu and Kashmir and one each in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra (Fig FH5). 
Change in minimum temperature: As with maximum temperature, minimum temperature is also projected 
to increase in all the districts of the country. The increase ranged from <1.30C in 199 districts to >1.60C in 
89 districts. Many of the latter are in the states of Madhya Pradesh (15), Jammu and Kashmir (13), Himachal 
Pradesh (12), Rajasthan (10), Uttar Pradesh (8) and Uttarakhand (8) (Fig FH6).
Change in incidence of unusually hot days: Number of days with abnormally high maximum temperature 
during March to May is expected to increase by more than one in 54 districts. A majority of these districts are 
in the Himalayan states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, north-eastern states and in 
Punjab (Fig FH7).
Change in incidence of unusually cold days: Frequency of days with lower than normal minimum temperature 
during December to February is projected to increase, though marginally, in 526 districts. Noticeable increase 
in such conditions is projected to occur in 29 districts (Chhattisgarh (8), Uttar Pradesh (8), Madhya Pradesh 
(7), Maharashtra (4), and one each in Odisha and Rajasthan (Fig FH8).
Change in occurrence of frost: The number of days when the minimum temperature goes below 00C remain 
about the same in 548 districts and to decrease by more than 10 days in 11 districts of Jammu and Kashmir 
(Fig FH9). 
Change in drought proneness: The incidence of drought, expressed in terms of severe drought equivalents, is 
projected to increase in about 302 districts and to decrease in 144 districts. Many of the districts where drought 
incidence is projected to increase are in Uttar Pradesh (38), Madhya Pradesh (25), Bihar (22), Rajasthan (19), 
Tamil Nadu (19), Maharashtra (18), Assam (14), Odisha (13), and Uttarakhahnd (10) (Fig FH10).
Change in incidence of Dry Spells: Expressed as a score computed based on the number of dry spells of at 
least 14 days duration, incidence of dry spells is projected to in 119 districts. It is expected to remain as in the 
baseline situation in 85 districts (Fig FH11).
Change in 99 percentile of daily rainfall: An increase in the value of this indicator is associated with increase 
in extreme rainfall hazard. The 99 percentile rainfall is expected to increase by 4mm 20 districts (Gujarat (8), 
Meghalaya (3), Daman & Diu (3)). It is projected to increase by 2 to 4 mm in 283 districts many of which are 
in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam, Tamil Nadu, etc (Fig FH12).
22
Change in number of events with more than 100 mm rainfall in three consecutive days: The incidence of 
this extreme rainfall event is expected to increase in all the districts. The frequency of such events is expected 
to increase by more than 1.5 in Arunachal Pradesh (6 districts), Kerala (4), Meghalaya (4), Sikkim (3), Gujarat 
(2), Assam (2), Maharashtra (2), one each in Bihar and Uttarakhand (Fig FH13). 
Change in mean maximum rainfall in single event: The amount of rainfall in one single event expressed 
as per cent to annual rainfall is expected to increase marginally in most of the districts except in 55 districts 
where it is projected to decrease marginally. Many of these 55 districts are in Gujarat (11), Maharashtra (10), 
Rajasthan (9), Madhya Pradesh (7) and Tamil Nadu (6) (Fig FH14). 
Change in mean maximum rainfall in three consecutive days: This is also an indicator of extreme rainfall 
event and is expressed as the amount of maximum rainfall received in three consecutive days in relation to the 
annual rainfall. Any increase in this is associated with increase in the possible flood hazard. It is projected to 
increase by more than 0.4 per cent in 25 districts and by 0.2 to 0.4 per cent in 174 districts (Fig FH15).
4.5. Risk and its determinants
Exposure: Exposure summarizes the five indicators of who and what are being exposed to the hazard of 
climate change. ‘Very high’ exposure can be seen in 50 districts most of which are in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, 
Kerala and West Bengal. About 127 districts are found to have ‘high’ exposure. ‘Low’ and ‘very low’ exposure 
is observed in 192 districts (Fig E6 and Table 8).
Vulnerability: This is an aggregation of 15 indicators and indicates the predisposition to the hazard. 
Vulnerability is found to be ‘high’ and ‘very high’ in 171 and 22 districts, respectively. Many of them are in 
the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, 
Karnataka, etc. Districts with ‘low’ and ‘very low’ vulnerability are in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Tamil 
Nadu, West Bengal, Gujarat, etc (Fig V16 and Table 9). 
Historical Hazard: Computed based on the historical incidence of three hazards of drought, flood and cyclone, 
‘very high’ historical hazard is observed in 46 districts and ‘high’ historical hazard in 128 districts. Districts 
that experience more than one of the three hazards are likely to suffer more. For example, districts on the coast 
suffer from both flood and cyclone and some districts in Gujarat suffer from both drought and cyclone. Thus, 
districts with relatively higher historical hazard are in the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil 
Nadu, Punjab, Haryana, West Bengal, etc (Fig HH4 and Table 10).
Future Hazard: Computed as an aggregate of a number of agriculturally relevant indicators computed 
using climate projections for RCP 4.5, future climate is likely to be ‘more unfavourable’ in 126 districts and 
‘moderately unfavourable’ 199 districts. Thus, climate change implies a worsening situation in many of the 
districts in the country (Fig FH16 and Table 11). 
Climate Change Risk: Risk is the resultant of interaction among exposure, vulnerability and hazard. The 
analysis indicated ‘very high’ risk for 109 districts in Uttar Pradesh (22), Rajasthan (17), Bihar (10), Kerala (8), 
Uttarakhand (7), Odisha (6), Punjab (5), and the remaining in the states of West Bengal, Karnataka, Haryana, 
Gujarat, Mizoram, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, etc. Most of the 201 districts with ‘high’ risk are in Uttar Pradesh, 
Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Bihar, Odisha, Maharashtra, etc. These districts have 
to be given high priority while planning for measures for protecting agriculture and farmers from the adverse 
impacts of climate change (Fig R1 and Table 12).

Tables 8 to 12 and figures E6, HH4, FH16, V16 and R1 present the distribution of districts across states 
based on different determinants of risk and also based on degree of risk. In order to identify appropriate 
interventions that help reduce risk, identification of sources of risk for districts identified to have relatively 
more risk to climate change will be helpful. Table 13 identifies one most important factor contributing most to 
each determinant of risk. Thus, four important sources of risk are identified for each of the districts with ‘high’ 
and ‘very high’ risk.
5.1. Sources of risk for targeting interventions
Among various drivers of exposure, high proportion of NSA in relation to the geographical area is identified 
as the most prominent one as it is contributing most to exposure in 134 of 310 districts. A land use pattern that 
reflects high NSA indicates high population pressure, less area under other land uses such as forests and also 
high fertility and productivity of soils as in case of states such as Punjab. Many of these districts are in Uttar 
Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka, etc. When NSA is high, more area is being 
exposed to climate change and even a moderate hazard can afflict considerable damage. Social backwardness 
as reflected in the high per cent of SC/ST population is identified as the most significant cause of exposure in 
71 districts many of which are located in north-eastern states. These groups of population are not well placed 
in terms of literacy, income levels, access to economic infrastructure, etc. which make them more susceptible 
to hazard when exposed. Dominance of small and marginal farmers in Indian agriculture is well known. The 
problems such as lack of economies of scale, weak bargaining power, difficulties in accessing information and 
capital associated with small farm size are a cause of vulnerability and a high proportion of small and marginal 
farmers emerged as a strong exposure-related risk driver in 52 of 310 districts identified as having ‘very high’ 
or ‘high’ risk. Exposure is also concerned with existence of high value capital assets in places of occurrence of 
a hazard. In agriculture, cross-bred cattle is one such example. Cross-bred cattle are highly productive but also 
sensitive to climate variability and require high investments in fodder, veterinary care, etc. Presence of high 
proportion of cross-bred cattle is driving risk in 29 districts of which 10 are in Kerala and a few in Tamil Nadu, 
Karnataka, Jammu & Kashmir, etc. High population density is a cause of high risk in 14 districts of Bihar and 
a few in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Kerala.
Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns are the two most significant aspects of climate change in relation 
to agriculture. A rising temperature is evident from historical trends which further increases the importance 
of access to irrigation. Low access to irrigation, expressed in terms of per cent NSA with access to irrigation, 
emerged as the most prominent vulnerability-related driver of risk in 116 districts. Expansion, equitable access 
to and efficiency of irrigation have to receive more attention as part of any adaptation strategy. Harvesting 
rainwater, in-situ conservation and groundwater recharge should be the three principal supply side components 
of water management in rainfed areas. In both irrigated and rainfed areas, demand management for irrigation 
water holds key to more sustainable water use. This requires changes in cropping pattern as per the actual plans 
of irrigation projects on one hand and promotion of crops that require less water in rainfed regions on the other. 
Technologies (e.g. micro-irrigation), policies and other instruments have to be purposefully tailored together 
to suit different regions in this regard. Low annual rainfall was found to be an important source of risk in 91 
districts.

Note: - indicates that the respective component is not a significant contributor to risk
The interventions to manage low rainfall to an extent overlap with those related to irrigation. However, the 
relative importance of ex situ and in situ rainwater harvesting vary with the quantity and distribution of rainfall 
and with spatial linkages with other districts. Other related factors contributing to high risk are the available 
water holding capacity of soils and groundwater availability which are contributing to high risk in 56 and 
13 districts, respectively. The former is a slowly responding feature of the soils and therefore needs long 
term strategies and investments in soil and water conservation, building organic carbon levels, innovative 
groundwater recharge methods, farm level water harvesting through farm ponds, etc. Presence of large extent 
of degraded lands, because of their poor ability to support crop growth, enhances vulnerability and thus risk 
of climate change. This factor is identified as a major source of risk in 13 districts. This also requires long 
term efforts in soil conservation, runoff management, land reclamation, pasture management, green capping 
etc. and have to be matched by focused crop improvement programmes for developing appropriate varieties. 
Poor profitability and high dependence on agriculture as reflected in high income inequity in agriculture, poor 
literacy and inadequate road and electricity infrastructure are other vulnerability-related drivers of risk in a few 
districts. Appropriate interventions are required for strengthening such factors.
85
Among the historical hazard related factors, high incidence of drought was contributing the most to risk in 
156 districts, cyclone in 93 districts and flood in 61 districts. They require suitable interventions and long term 
strategies with adequate investments in forecasting and forewarning capacities and related infrastructure. Even 
the farmers’ perceptions indicate the desirability of and preference to such interventions by the Government 
(Rama Rao et al., 2018). Breeding for drought and submergence tolerant crop varieties, investments in situ 
and ex situ rainwater management for enabling critical irrigation, creating infrastructure for storage of produce 
immediately after harvest to protect from flood or cyclonic rains, creation of wind breaks, preserving coastal 
ecosystems (mangroves, wet lands, etc.), strengthening river banks, etc. are some of the interventions needed 
in managing such hazards.
Climate change projections indicate rise in temperature with more certainty and it is the minimum (night) 
temperature that is rising more than the maximum temperature. Heat stress/or rising temperature is emerging 
as an important factor in determining crop yields (Jayaraman and Murari, 2014) and has not received as much 
attention as the rainfall deficits did in the Indian context. This analysis shows that rise in minimum temperature 
is the most significant factor in determining risk in 271 districts. The impact of rising minimum temperature 
or warmer nights in rabi crops like wheat is evident from many studies. Some of the desirable interventions in 
this regard are advancing sowing dates, adoption of short duration varieties, etc. Similarly, rise in maximum 
temperature was identified as a key driver of risk in six districts. Increase in drought incidence is a cause of 
high climate change risk in 24 districts. More and better focussed efforts are required for managing drought in 
these districts. Though gradually changing climate (temperature and rainfall) has received some implicit and 
explicit attention in research efforts, the effects of incidence of extreme events on crop productivity and on 
how to minimize extreme event-induced crop losses have not received much attention. Incidence of extreme 
rainfall events was found to be contributing to risk in ten districts. Forewarning and quick action are the two 
challenges that have to be addressed in this regard.
Climate and climate change is a spatial phenomenon and hence climate change risk also varies spatially. The 
analysis showed the variability in risk and also the relative importance of different determinants of risk across 
districts. Thus, it is important to develop strategies that recognize the location specificity of the extent and 
causes of risk. Further, it may be more pragmatic to approach risk reduction through addressing vulnerability as 
reducing exposure is more difficult and require more long term and cross-sector polices and climate projections 
have always an element of uncertainty and heavy reliance on them as a means of risk reduction may potentially 
lead to maladaptation.
5.2. Prioritization of districts for resource allocation
The risk analysis presented so far is based on the indicators expressed in terms of proportions within in the 
district and can be considered as ‘intensity based’ analysis. For example, relatively more area in relation 
to geographical area may be under cultivation (NSA), but it may be smaller in extent compared to another 
district where the NSA is lower in terms of per cent geographical area but may be considerably larger in 
terms of actual extent. From the perspective of the district concerned, such an ‘intensity’ based risk measure 
is appropriate. Resource allocation exclusively on this basis may lead to exclusion of some districts where 
the ‘exposure’ is very high in actual units, which when exposed even to a moderate hazard, may result in 
considerable magnitude of impact from the country’s or states perspective. Considering such extensity of what 
is being exposed to hazard along with the intensity based risk metric may be of interest to policy makers while 
allocating resources with a view to include ‘more area’ or ‘more people’ in any targeted programme. In order 
to inform such decisions, the intensity based risk is multiplied with the average of the proportion of the district 
in country’s net sown area and in country’s agricultural workforce to arrive at an intensity-cum-extensity based 
risk measure and the districts are categorized as in case of intensity based risk (Fig. R2 and Table 14). In this 
case, a district with ‘high’ or ‘medium’ risk (intensity based measure), if bigger in terms of NSA or agricultural 
workforce, can become district with ‘very high’ or ‘high’ risk (intensity-cum extensity based measure). A 
few districts in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar are examples of such shifts between 
the two risk measures. The reverse is also possible as in case of a few districts in Kerala, Punjab, Jammu & 
Kashmir, Uttarakhand, etc.

Based on this measure of risk that considers both intensity and extensity, 55 districts were categorized as those 
with ‘very high’ risk and are largely in the states of Rajasthan (17), Uttar Pradesh (10), Karnataka (5), Bihar 
(5), Maharashtra (4), and West Bengal (4). Of the 154 districts categorized into ‘high’ risk, 31 are in Uttar 
Pradesh, 17 in Madhya Pradesh, 14 in Bihar, 13 in Odisha, 11 in Karnataka, 9 in Rajasthan and others in the 
states of Punjab, West Bengal, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand, etc. Thus, the output of the analysis 
can be used as demanded by the context and purpose. For example, if the plan or programme has to be prepared 
for a few districts to deal with climate change hazard, use of intensity based risk measure is more relevant and 
if the purpose is to cover a larger area and larger number of people, with considerable resource allocation, the 
intensity-cum-extensity based measure may be more meaningful. This perspective is taken because the IPCC 
defines a risk as a key risk when the magnitude of risk is high among other things.
88
Conceptually, vulnerability arises when an entity or a system of interest is exposed to a situation which it is 
not used to deal with or an abnormal situation. Considering this, any deviation in climatic variables such as 
rainfall, temperature should be assumed to increase vulnerability as such deviations necessitate adaptation of 
the economic activity to the emerging scenario. However, given the nature of agriculture in majority of regions 
in India, it is more difficult to adapt to decreasing rainfall and rising temperature than to increasing rainfall and 
decreasing temperature. Sensitivity of crops to heat (temperature) stress is evident and irrigation is one of the 
key desired management responses. Therefore, we assumed that rising temperature and decreasing rainfall will 
have adverse impacts on agriculture. However, increase in extreme rainfall and temperature related events are 
assumed be undesirable and hazardous. 
The normalization methods applied while using indicator method assumes linear relationship between the 
indicator and the phenomenon it is selected to be associated with which many not be the case in reality. We 
attempted to moderate such issues by fixing upper or lower bounds (e.g. annual rainfall, rural population 
density, net per capita income, livestock density, fertiliser use, future hazard indicators), transformation of 
the indicators (e.g. number of markets, dry spells). Obtaining data on all indicators for given reference year is 
ideal but extremely difficult to get for all the districts in the country. We have taken care to obtain the data for 
the most recent year depending on availability. Missing values are handled by using the data for immediately 
preceding year, using the respective state average, etc. The data on indicators for districts in Andhra Pradesh 
and Telangana refer to the pre-2014 boundaries.
Climate projections are made available for different RCPs and for different time slices. We used in this 
study the projections for the period 2020-49 based on the RCP 4.5 in line with other climate change related 
communications such as Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) which have outlined certain 
targets for 2030. The RCP 4.5 is also considered as more likely scenario. This choice emerged in a consultation 
meeting with different stakeholder organizations though we presented the results based on two RCPs for a 
distant time slice of 2040-2069. 
In terms of coverage of the districts, the study considered only those districts as appearing in 2001 census 
leaving out the urban districts. Though many new districts have been created since then, they could not be 
included due to non-availability of data on some of the indicators used in the analysis. Further, the two island 
Union Territories of Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep could not be included as we could not get 
climate projections for them.
Finally, we would like to discourage any comparison of these findings with those of Rama Rao et al., (2013) 
though we mentioned that this exercise started as its revision. Such a comparison is not meaningful as the 
two differ in terms of conceptualization, definitions, data, especially of climate projections. Even the way the 
districts were categorized is different owing to different normalization methods and the consequent criteria 
used for categorization of districts.
