Abstract
Hazards in the Wake of 
Climate Change Induced 
Extreme Weather Events 
and Their Impact on 
Indian Fisheries
 
Climate change, whether driven by natural or human forcing, can lead to 
changes in the likelihood of the occurrence or strength of extreme weather and 
climate events or both. In recent past, the increased occurrence of extreme climatic 
events has caused enormous damage to åsheries sector particularly to the tropical 
coastal countries such as India. The vagaries of climate are reýected in many forms, 
such as changes in temperature and rainfall pattern, which consequently lead to 
increased frequency of extreme events such as ýoods, cyclones, heat anomalies 
and unpredictable monsoons. These are further exacerbated by the activities such 
as anthropogenic enrichment of the coastal environment through coastal 
aquaculture farming, ballast water discharge, tourism, damming and so on.  
Further, the climate change impacts are also expected to intensify in the years 
ahead. Some of the resilient strategies, such as hazard mapping, spatial planning, 
participatory planning and capacity building, are the need of the hour for 
mitigating these hazards caused due to climate change induced extreme weather 
events and their impact on Indian åsheries.

Climate Change and Indian Agriculture: Challenges and Adaptation Strategies
449
Events such as ýoods, droughts, 
cyclones, tsunamis, etc. are the 
extreme weather scenarios that 
åshers, åsh farmers and coastal 
population, in general, are 
confronting as the impacts of climate 
change, with increased intensity and 
frequency. It is important to initiate 
necessary steps and precautions to 
face the worsening impacts, which 
can be part of the adaptation 
strategy for mitigating them.
The increasing frequency and 
intensity of extreme weather events 
lead to intense coastal vulnerability 
and consequent severe socio-
economic impacts. The crisis is a multi-
faceted challenge for developing 
countries such as India demanding 
holistic approaches to reinvigorate 
the diminishing resilience of the poor 
and vulnerable sections of the coastal 
population. 
I. Introduction
Climate change impact crisis is an 
important world-wide environmental 
emergency which has far-fetched 
signiåcant implication in agriculture 
sector including åsheries (Srinivasarao 
et al., 2019). Frequent ýoods, 
droughts, ocean acidiåcation and 
rising sea levels, all due to climate 
changes pose a challenge as a whole, 
and the available reports suggest that 
the developing countries including 
India are more vulnerable since it is 
causing a huge impact on all 
dimensions of the society. Further, the 
climate change impacts are also 
expected to intensify in the years 
ahead.
With the changes in surface 
temperature of sea water, there are 
observed changes in the patterns of 
A similar situation is prevailing in case 
of cold waves also. These two 
weather extremes are inýuenced by 
the changes in ENSO phases (El Nino 
and La Nina). In the northern Indian 
Ocean region, there is a serious 
inýuence of Indian Ocean Dipole 
(IOD) events also which is having a 
cascading effect on the åshery in the 
region (Prathibha et al., 2018). 
Extreme events, such as tropical 
cyclones, heat waves, cold waves, 
droughts, ýoods, etc., have the 
potential to cause human loss, injury 
and huge economic losses to the 
In India, there is an increasing 
trend of heat waves which is 
associated with the global warming 
(Perkins et al., 2012). The current 
decade has experienced more than 
double the number of heatwaves 
compared to the previous decade 
(Fig.1).           
rainfall, evaporation, onset and 
duration of seasons and frequency of 
extreme events. This indicates that 
climate change is posing signiåcant 
environmental challenge requiring an 
efåcient disaster management at 
present. With the past experiences 
over the extreme events due to 
climate change, we can develop 
better strategies for risk management 
and adaptation. These strategies are 
to be supported with scientiåc 
information on climate trends in 
order to reduce the rising human, 
economic and ånancial losses due to 
extreme weather events triggered by 
abnormal climate variabilities.

country (Fig.2). Large proportion of 
the global population is affected by 
the natural disasters and these 
numbers are ýuctuating every year. 
Some of these disasters are very 
difåcult to predict (Ray-Bennett and 
Nibedita, 2018).      
Fluctuation in rainfall alters the 
hydrological cycle and the pattern of 
basic stream ýow. This will call for a 
review of reservoir design and 
management practices in India. The 
patterns of annual rainfall in India 
have been irregular and inconsistent 
in the past decades (Fig.3). The 
ýuctuating rainfall pattern with a 
declining trend in recent decades 
threatens the biodiversity and åshery 
production of our country (Kumar et 
al., 2010). It was observed that there 
had been many cyclones in the Bay of 
Bengal compared to the Arabian Sea. 
Though the number of cyclones is on 
marginal decline in recent years, their 
intensiåcations are high compared to 
earlier decades (Fig.4).

Hazards in the Wake of Climate Change Induced Extreme Weather Events 
Extreme events, in nature, can be 
deåned as the occurrence of those 
calamities which are spontaneous, 
unpredictable and uncontrollable 
within the short time of its evolution 
or any such hazardous happenings 
which threaten the existence of 
livelihoods depending directly or 
indirectly on different coastal 
ecosystems and their provision of 
goods and services. For example, it 
can be ýooding of rivers in north 
eastern hilly areas during monsoon, 
cyclones along Odisha coast or 
landslides in Western Ghats during 
south west monsoon season and so 
on. Complexities in extreme events, 
The increasing frequency of 
occurrence of harmful algal blooms 
(HABs) in Indian coastal waters is a 
serious issue as the greater is the 
number of the HABs observed, more 
is the severity in deterioration effect 
on the quality of Indian coastal 
waters and åsheries (Padmakumar et 
al., 2012).
III. Complexities in 
Extreme Events
III.1 Extreme Floods
associated with weather elements or 
effect of anomalies of different 
meteorological parameters (eg. solar 
radiation, sea surface temperature, 
precipitation, etc.), can be described 
as natural calamities which bring 
forth scalable disaster after their 
occurrence threatening the very 
existence of life and human 
settlements. For example, there can 
be heavy loss of life and damages to 
coastal structures due to Tsunami or 
destruction of roadways and 
communication facilities soon after 
landslides/ýoods etc. Any such event's 
origin and occurrence regionally 
associated with climate change has 
produced serious impacts on åsh and 
åsheries also. It also causes serious 
damage and loss to different 
stakeholders associated with åsheries 
and aquaculture (Zacharia et al., 
2016).
Floods during the monsoon 
season in Indian sub-continent are 
considered to be among the 
unpredictable extreme events which 
hamper the food åsh production both

Hazards in the Wake of Climate Change Induced Extreme Weather Events 
from capture åsheries and through 
commercial aquaculture practices. In 
general, the south-west monsoon 
season, along the south-west coast of 
India (Kerala and Karnataka coast), is 
one of the two rainy seasons which 
receives maximum rainfall. This 
season, in particular, receives heavy 
rainfall which causes ýoods in the 
tropical rivers of Kerala and 
Karnataka. Subsequently, the multi-
purpose dams and reservoirs 
constructed in these states, are also 
ýooded during the season 
immediately after heavy showers 
during the mid-monsoon. Heavy 
rainfall, followed by ýooding in rivers 
along with the anomalies in monsoon 
winds over the coastal seas, causes 
severe impacts on marine åsh 
production. The changes in breeding 
patterns of different pelagic and 
estuarine åshes (as ýooding alters the 
environment, habitat and living 
conditions and monsoon winds alter 
the micro-climate at regional levels), 
delayed or reduced recruitment of 
different åsh resources, etc., are some 
of the after-effects of extreme ýood 
occurrences. 
Extreme ýoods also bring in huge 
loads of nutrient-rich sediments to 
the coastal waters which through 
upwelling reach the surface waters. 
This sediment loading in the sea has 
differential effects on åsh production, 
sometimes detrimental even.  The 
delta formation with sediment loads, 
along the east coast of India in Bay of 
Bengal, is also having signiåcant role 
in inýuencing the coastal åsh 
production. The rivers' discharge 
during heavy monsoon and the 
ensuing ýoods observed in major 
rivers such as Godavari, Krishna, 
Ganges, etc., contribute to vagaries in 
Monsoon winds inýuence the 
agro-climate of Indian sub-continent 
signiåcantly. Monsoon winds enter in 
the Indian subcontinent along the 
southwest coast of India and bring in 
rains all along the western part of 
Western Ghats. These heavy showers 
over Kerala and Karnataka are 
important for the productivity of 
coastal and inland water bodies 
(
). The direct 
Shafeeque et al., 2019
dependence of åshes on rainfall is 
that the onset of monsoon rainfall 
along with favouring temperature 
induces åshes to spawn and 
reproduce naturally. Increased rainfall 
and changing water currents in sea 
also favour primary and secondary 
food sources' growth such as that of 
phyto and zoo plankton. Plankton 
blooming also is boosted by 
upwelling phenomenon. Upwelling 
episodes along with the mud bank 
formation in sea, during peak 
monsoon season, high rate of 
plankton multiplication followed by 
increase in shrimp and åsh 
reproduction. Mud bank formation in 
sea along the Kerala coast is due to 
the sediment discharge by rivers 
draining into the sea during the rainy 
season. Increased river ýows and 
sediments draining into coastal 
waters get accumulated and form 
colloids in the column and bottom, 
relatively at lower depths (15-20 m) 
åsh production. However, altered and 
increased ýooding along with 
increased pollutant loads from the 
mainland reaching though ýood 
water and sediment make the 
environmental conditions at sea 
unfavourable for åsh growth and 
production (Gibson et al., 2002). 
III.2 Unpredictable Monsoons

454
Hazards in the Wake of Climate Change Induced Extreme Weather Events 
which form the nutrients' source. 
Upwelling brings these nutrients from 
colloidal mass in deeper waters to the 
surface. Where rainfall is high, it 
triggers plankton blooming offering 
primary food source to coastal pelagic 
resources. In reality, any alterations in 
monsoon wind patterns negatively 
inýuence the åsh production. Similar 
is  the case in other coastal areas also. 
Anomalies in rainfall pattern directly 
inýuence the primary producers' 
biomass and thus åshes also, as they 
occupy all other trophic levels linked 
to the årst trophic level. Late arrival 
of monsoon winds inýuences the 
brooders to spawn asynchronously or 
to reabsorb the gonadal contents in 
their body itself. It also results in 
larval mortalities due to lesser 
abundance of food-planktons and 
other live åsh food organisms in 
water, relatively higher water 
temperature, etc. All these reduce the 
recruitment intensity and thus åsh 
production. Altered and uncertain 
rainfall patterns thus reduce the åsh 
production dramatically. 
III.3 Intense Heatwaves
There has been a tremendous rise 
in the intense heatwave events 
affecting the human comfort globally. 
It is the abnormally high 
temperatures, more than the normal 
maximum temperature that occurs 
between March and June usually in 
North-Western parts of India, 
adversely affecting the folks as they 
cause physiological stress, sometimes 
resulting in death (NDMP, 2016). The 
re-curving tropical cyclones before 
the onset of the heatwaves could 
change the direction of the winds and 
cut-off moisture to the inland regions 
leading to heatwaves (De et al., 
1998). The abnormally high 
temperature anomalies have been 
recorded over south India and coastal 
eastern India (Ratnam et al., 2016). 
The climatology on sea level anomaly 
in northern Indian Ocean indicate an 
anomalous low-pressure area along 
the east coast of India indicating the 
moisture driven winds blowing out of 
India and transported to the cyclonic 
anomalies in the west Paciåc. The 
transport of the moisture out of the 
Indian coast causes the reduction in 
precipitation along the east coast of 
India (Ratnam et al., 2016).
Fisheries and aquaculture are 
among the critical sectors as they are 
dependent on nature to variable 
extent. The vagaries of climate are 
reýected in many forms, such as 
changes in temperature and rainfall 
pattern, which consequently lead to 
increased frequency of extreme 
events such as ýoods, cyclones, heat 
anomalies and unpredictable 
monsoons. These are further 
exacerbated by the activities such as 
anthropogenic enrichment of the 
coastal environment through coastal 
aquaculture farming, ballast water 
discharge, tourism, etc. Changing 
land use cover, reservoir storage and 
agricultural and industrial operations 
in the vicinities are altering the 
functions of natural habitats such as 
brackish water wetlands as seen in 
the case of Kerala ýoods. 
The scale of impacts can be seen in 
various perspectives as discussed 
below.
IV. Impacts on Fisheries
Climate Change and Indian Agriculture: Challenges and Adaptation Strategies
455
Hazards in the Wake of Climate Change Induced Extreme Weather Events 
The Fani cyclone, 2018 caused a 
severe impact on shrimp production 
of Odisha. It not only affected the 
aquaculture farms but also the 
seafood processing units due to 
power failure, incurring a loss of 
around Rs.30-400 crores (Krishna 
Kumar, 2019). 
Floods in Kerala have cascading effect 
on åsh farming ventures in sheltered 
areas of the coast that are used for 
pen and cage åsh farming in the 
state. Many times, the ready to 
harvest crops of Pearl Spot, Sea Bass 
and Red Snapper are lost in the usual 
ýoods occurring ahead of the Onam 
season when they would have 
fetched maximum proåt due to 
festival peak sales. A total loss of Rs.4 
crores in the year 2018 was estimated 
for Ernakulum and Thrissur districts of  
Kerala (Kumar, 2018).
IV.2  Abundance of Competitors 
Fish, being a poikilothermic 
organism (Bowden et al., 2007), will 
be more severely affected than other 
homoeothermic animals and 
ultimately the production scenario 
would alter to the detriment due to 
extreme events in nature. For 
Instance, rising temperature in the 
Arabian Sea has extended the 
distribution of Indian oil sardine up to 
the north-western zone, but its 
spread can have severe impact on the 
Bombay duck having restricted 
distribution in the North-west coast 
of India (Rohit et al., 2018). It will not 
only enhance the competition for 
food and space but also outpace 
those species in competition whose 
distribution is restricted to speciåc 
environmental parameters; for 
instance, tidal oscillations in the case 
of Bombay duck.  
IV.1 Food Production
IV.4 Critical Ecosystem
IV.3 Impact on the Oceanic Food 
Webs
Marine heatwave happens when 
the ocean temperature is much 
warmer than usual for the time of 
year which may be due to heating of 
the surface water by excess sunlight 
or warm water being brought via 
ocean currents. In 2015, New Zealand 
experienced its longest and 
mostintense marine heatwave on 
record and it brought down the 
abundance of valuable tropical 
species like kingåsh and snapper 
(Oliver et al., 2017). In the 
aquaculture industry, it resulted in 
disease outbreaks in oyster farms, 
disruptions to salmon farming and 
death of abalones along the coast 
(Oliver et al., 2017).
Extreme marine heatwave lingered 
over the Shark Bay World Heritage 
area of western Australia in 2011, 
seagrass and kelp forests damaged in 
mass (
. Some 
Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018)
kelp species became regionally extinct 
over hundreds of kilometres. This loss 
was not only a direct effect of the 
heat, but also was due to herbivorous 
åsh migrating along with the warm 
water and foraging over the kelp. The 
kelps were also being replaced with 
seaweeds turfs, thus having severe 
impact on the kelp ecosystem (Arias-
Ortiz et al., 2018).
Strong storms, in terms of 
severity, are in increasing frequency 
and are inýuencing the mangrove 
productivity and health (Stocker et 
al., 2013). Activity, such as defoliating 
the canopy, uprooting trees, etc at 
the seaward margins are observed 
(Doyle et al., 1995). Changing rainfall 
patterns (Gilman et al., 2008),

abnormal precipitation and increase 
in evaporation have indirect effects, 
such as incremental increase in soil 
salinity and low survival of seedlings, 
reduced productivity and growth 
rates, and thus a heavy loss to 
mangrove ecosystem (Duke et al., 
1998). Coral reefs are among the 
critical ecosystems supporting 
åsheries, as well as, guarding our 
coastline against severe wave action 
and erosion. With extreme 
temperatures and solar irradiance, 
global warming and the resultant 
climate change, enhanced frequency 
of ýoods and abnormal rainfalls are 
directly or indirectly contributing to 
sea-level rise that is detrimental for 
already stressed coral reefs. Changed 
weather patterns, such as altered El 
Niño and La Niña events, are already 
affecting coral reefs. In 1998, the 
highest of the tropical sea surface 
temperatures (SSTs) recorded in the 
last 50 years, as a result of El Niño 
phenomenon, was recorded 
(Wilkinson et al., 1999) and the coral 
reefs suffered the most extensive and 
severe mass bleaching episodes, 
resulting in obliteration of 16 per 
cent of the world's coral reefs and 50 
percent of those in the Indian Ocean 
(Wilkinson et al., 1999).
IV.5 Socioeconomic Sustainability 
The åshing community suffers 
greatly due to the loss of 
infrastructure such as boats, nets and 
other åshing equipment, during 
events such as cyclone and ýood. 
Mental trauma and grievances take 
time to heal and subside and get 
prepared to venture again into the 
sea. The women of the community, 
who used to sell åsh or work as casual 
labourers, also go without jobs. Thus, 
both men and women of the åshing 
community are unable to earn a living 
(Singh et al., 2018). Migration to 
other states for petty jobs is also 
visible from the cyclone affected 
areas of the country (Babu, 2018).
V. Towards Resilient 
Pathways
Climate change resilience mainly 
has two aspects - one is mitigation of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 
the other is adaptation to impacts of 
climate change on different eco-
systems and their services. Recently, 
climate change has emerged as a 
global environmental challenge. In 
1992, with the adoption of United 
Nations Framework Convention to 
Climate Change (UNFCCC), different 
steps were taken to address the effect 
of climate change. India is a party to 
UNFCCC and the Government of India 
gives signiåcant importance to 
climate change issues. Disaggregated 
impacts of climate change affect the 
rd
th
åsheries sector. The 73  and 74  
Amendment Acts, 1992, of the 
Constitution of India have given 
immense power to local governments 
at rural and urban levels, respectively, 
which reýect the commitment of 
Indian Government in the direction of 
mitigation of climate change.
V.1 Dimensions of Exposure and 
Resilience Pathways
To build resilience to the effects 
of climate change and to derive 
sustainable beneåts, åsheries 
managers, as a top priority, need to 
adopt and adhere to best practices 
such as those described in the FAO 
Code of Conduct for Responsible 
Fisheries and the EAF/EAA. Progress in 
Climate Change and Indian Agriculture: Challenges and Adaptation Strategies
458
Hazards in the Wake of Climate Change Induced Extreme Weather Events 
this direction would be an important 
contribution to maintaining 
biodiversity, preserving the resilience 
of human and aquatic systems to 
climate change, and improving our 
capacity to anticipate and adapt to 
inevitable climate induced changes in 
aquatic ecosystems and the related 
åsheries production systems. 
V.2 Hazard Mapping
V.3 Community based Experiences
A hazard mapping is intended for 
highlighting the areas that are 
already affected by different hazards 
and those vulnerable to speciåed 
hazards. They are typically created in 
relevance to natural hazards, such as 
earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, 
ýooding and tsunamis. For 
vulnerability assessment, three 
vulnerability factors are used which 
are exposure, sensitivity and adaptive 
capacity. Exposure refers to people, 
property, systems, etc. present in 
hazard zones that are thereby subject 
to potential impacts of climate 
change. Sensitivity means 
responsiveness of a system to climate 
hazards. Adaptive capacity refers to 
the ability of a system to adjust to the 
impacts like those of climate change. 
For preparing communities and 
people to meet the challenges arising 
out of such changes, information 
speciåc to a state or even district is 
needed because such impacts of 
climate change are not uniform. In 
order to meet this need, a national 
level climate vulnerability assessment 
map needs to be developed.
Community-based experiences 
can be combined in comparison to 
individual strategies across multiple 
setting aiming at the wellbeing of the 
At a different scale, traditional 
policy and management planning and 
tools will have to be “climate 
proofed”, by using GIS tools spatially 
and temporally – eg. Protected areas 
and closed seasons. At the regional 
level, agreements among countries 
sharing transboundary stocks will also 
need to be adjusted as shifts in stock 
distribution and changes in 
productivity occur. Fishing vessels of 
all sizes may be rendered more stable 
to allow for åshing farther away from 
the coastal area.  Fish aggregating 
devices may be used to lure åsh back 
within the traditional åshing areas.
V.4 Spatial Planning
Participatory planning is done by 
taking all the stakeholders in 
consideration for any management. 
For the extensive community 
engagement careful consideration of 
local culture, values, and belief 
systems is important as they play a 
major role in understanding future 
climate impacts. Capacity-building is 
about enhancing the ability of 
individuals, organizations and 
institutions in developing countries 
and in countries with economies in 
transition to identify, plan and 
implement ways to mitigate and 
adapt to climate change. 
V.5 Participatory Planning and 
Capacity Building 
society.   Based on their knowledge, 
experiences and availability of local 
resources including the social capital, 
community based vulnerability 
reduction and disaster management 
strategies can be formulated through 
wider development planning and 
debates.

Hazards in the Wake of Climate Change Induced Extreme Weather Events 
VI. Conclusion
Extreme events in recent years 
are drawing the increased attention 
to the science seeking to understand 
their causes as some extremes 
especially droughts, heat waves, 
cyclones and heavy precipitation 
events are becoming more frequent 
annually. Since natural variability is 
playing a substantial role in individual 
events, there is a need for a science-
A multilevel governance 
framework calls for the narrowing or 
closing of the policy “gaps” between 
levels of government via the adoption 
of tools for vertical and horizontal 
governance. The vertical dimension of 
multilevel governance recognises that 
national governments cannot 
effectively implement national 
climate strategies without working 
closely with regional and local 
governments as agents of change. 
The horizontal dimension of 
multilevel governance is also 
associated with improving 
coordination across national line 
ministries to implement crosscutting 
programmes, such as those required 
in many climate change policies. 
Whereas the multilevel governance 
approach recognises that local 
governmental authority has to act in 
areas of its jurisdiction with the close 
coordination of all link departments, 
institutions and local people for 
developing climate resilient strategies 
to mitigate the losses from the 
unpredictable and unavoidable 
extreme events and for the 
sustainability of the åsheries 
resources.

Governance

based evidence to assess how climate 
change has affected the strength and 
likelihood of individual extreme 
events. In order to ånd the resilient 
pathways to mitigate the 
overburdening impact of extreme 
events fueled by the impact of 
climate change there is need for 
strengthening local co-management 
plans, involving ﬁshers in data 
collection and analysis, developing 
complementary livelihood strategies 
and addressing the broad socio-
economic rights of communities. 
Participation in community-level 
vulnerability assessments enhances 
understanding, builds capacity, 
generates knowledge for 
management, and allows 
communities to identify locally 
appropriate adaptation strategies for 
climate change.
